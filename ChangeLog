2006-01-08 22:52  phase1geo

	Updating regression.  Full regression now passes.

2006-01-08 22:15  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix one last problem with latest changes.  Regression
	runs are currently running.  Checkpointing.

2006-01-07 23:51  phase1geo

	Added optimizations to EOR and AEDGE expressions.  In the process
	of running regressions...

2006-01-07 21:05  phase1geo

	Checkpointing work on optimized thread handling.  I believe that
	this is now working as wanted; however, regressions will not pass
	until EOR optimization has been completed.  I will be working on
	this next.

2006-01-06 17:39  phase1geo

	Started working on removing the need to simulate more than is
	necessary.  Things are pretty broken at this point, but all of the
	code should be in -- debugging.

2006-01-06 12:54  phase1geo

	Breaking up expression_operate function into individual functions
	for each expression operation.	Also storing additional information
	in a globally accessible, constant structure array to increase
	performance.  Updating full regression for these changes.  Full
	regression passes.

2006-01-04 23:56  phase1geo

	Updated TODO.

2006-01-04 23:52  phase1geo

	Removing wait bit in vector supplemental field and modifying
	algorithm to only assign in the post-sim location (pre-sim now is
	gone).	This fixes some issues with simulation results and
	increases performance a bit.  Updated regressions for these
	changes.  Full regression passes.

2006-01-04 16:07  phase1geo

	Changing expression execution calculation from sim to
	expression_operate function.  Updating all regression files for
	this change.  Modifications to diagnostic Makefile to accommodate
	environments that do not have valgrind.

2006-01-03 21:15  phase1geo

	Adding bassign3 diagnostic to regression suite to verify
	expression_assign function works correctly for CONCAT/LIST
	ordering.

2006-01-03 17:00  phase1geo

	Removing debugging output from last checkin.

2006-01-03 16:59  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in expression_assign function -- removed recursive
	assignment when the LHS expression is a signal, single-bit,
	multi-bit or static value (only recurse when the LHS is a CONCAT or
	LIST).	Fixing bug in db_close function to check if the instance
	tree has been populated before deallocating memory for it.  Fixing
	bug in report help information when Tcl/Tk is not available.  Added
	bassign2 diagnostic to regression suite to verify first described
	bug.

2006-01-02 15:35  phase1geo

	Added simulation performance statistical information to end of
	score command when we are in debug mode.

2005-12-30 23:00  phase1geo

	Updating regression due to recent changes in adding exec_num field
	in expression and removing the executed bit in the expression
	supplemental field.  This will eventually allow us to get
	information on where the simulator is spending the most time.

2005-12-30 21:30  phase1geo

	Various documentation updates.

2005-12-23 14:59  phase1geo

	Fixing assertion error in race condition checker.  Full regression
	runs cleanly.

2005-12-22 23:41  phase1geo

	Fixing several bugs in score command per bug report #1388339. 
	Fixed problem with race condition checker statement iterator to
	eliminate infinite looping (this was the problem in the original
	bug).  Also fixed expression assigment when static expressions are
	used in the LHS (caused an assertion failure).	Also fixed the race
	condition checker to properly pay attention to task calls, named
	blocks and fork statements to make sure that these are being
	handled correctly for race condition checking.	Fixed bug for
	signals that are on the LHS side of an assignment expression but is
	not being assigned (bit selects) so that these are NOT considered
	for race conditions.  Full regression is a bit broken now but the
	opened bug can now be closed.

2005-12-22 17:04  phase1geo

	More memory leak fixes.

2005-12-21 17:16  phase1geo

	More memory leak fixes.

2005-12-21 16:30  phase1geo

	More updates to memory leak fix list.  We are getting close!  Added
	some helper scripts/rules to more easily debug valgrind memory leak
	errors.  Also added suppression file for valgrind for a memory leak
	problem that exists in lex-generated code.

2005-12-20 23:10  phase1geo

	Removing excess verbage from run.

2005-12-19 17:11  phase1geo

	now been eliminated from regression -- just left-over memory issues
	remain.

2005-12-18 23:18  phase1geo

	Fixing memory leak problems with instance1.1.  Full regression has
	some segfaults that need to be looked at now.

2005-12-16 23:47  phase1geo

	More memory fault fixes.  Regression runs cleanly and we have
	verified no memory faults up to define3.v.  Still have a ways to
	go.

2005-12-16 17:26  phase1geo

	Last set of memory leak fixes to get all assign diagnostics to run
	cleanly.

2005-12-16 17:09  phase1geo

2005-12-16 00:27  phase1geo

	Updating regression to pass.

2005-12-16 00:25  phase1geo

	Fixing lshift/rshift operations to avoid reading unallocated
	memory.  Updated assign1.cdd file.

2005-12-15 11:24  phase1geo

	More fixes for memory fault clean-up.  At this point all of the
	always diagnostics have been run and come up clean with valgrind. 
	Full regression passes.

2005-12-14 17:25  phase1geo

	Checkpointing some more memory fault fixes.

2005-12-14 17:03  phase1geo

	More updates to remove memory faults.  Still a work in progress but
	full regression passes.

2005-12-13 17:15  phase1geo

	More fixes for memory leaks.  Regression fully passes at this
	point.

2005-12-12 17:25  phase1geo

	Fixing memory faults.  This is a work in progress.

2005-12-11 23:40  phase1geo

	Adding valgrind to Makefile (temporary solution for now)

2005-12-11 21:46  phase1geo

	Adding exclusion to score command to improve performance.  Updated
	regression which now fully passes.

2005-12-10 00:41  phase1geo

	Added support for FOR loops and added diagnostics to regression
	suite to verify functionality.	Fixed statement deallocation
	function (removed a bunch of code there now that statement stopping
	is working as intended).  Full regression passes.

2005-12-08 16:50  phase1geo

	Adding support for while loops.  Added while1 and while1.1 to
	regression suite.  Ran VCS on regression suite and updated.  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-08 13:46  phase1geo

	Fixed repeat2 simulation issues.  Fixed statement_connect
	algorithm, removed the need for a separate set_stop function and
	reshuffled the positions of esuppl bits.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-07 16:02  phase1geo

	Added new repeat2 diagnostic to regression suite.  This brings out
	a statement_connect error that still needs to be looked at --
	currently causes just this diagnostic to segfault.

2005-12-07 15:50  phase1geo

	Added support for repeat blocks.  Added repeat1 to regression and
	fixed errors.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-07 14:23  phase1geo

	Fixing case where statement is unconnectable.  Full regression now
	passes.

2005-12-06 13:40  phase1geo

	Updating regression for VCS run.  Added regression restart ability
	to Makefiles when problems/errors occur for a given regression run
	(only reruns failed/unrun diagnostics the next time a regression is
	run).  Full regression passes at this point.

2005-12-06 09:42  phase1geo

	Added disable2.1 diagnostic to regression suite.  Fixed bad output
	from line coverage reports.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-05 17:30  phase1geo

	Adding support for disabling tasks.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-05 16:45  phase1geo

	Bug fixes to disable code when disabling ourselves -- we move
	thread killing to be done by the sim_thread routine only.

2005-12-05 16:02  phase1geo

	Added initial support for disable expression.  Added test to verify
	functionality.	Full regression passes.

2005-12-05 15:28  phase1geo

	Getting fork statements with scope to work.  Added test to
	regression to verify this functionality.  Fixed bug in binding
	expression to named block.

2005-12-05 14:26  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in code to remove statement blocks that are pointed to
	by expressions in NB_CALL and FORK cases.  Fixed bugs in fork code
	-- this is now working at the moment.  Updated regressions which
	now fully pass.

2005-12-02 13:58  phase1geo

	Added initial support for FORK/JOIN expressions.  Code is not
	working correctly yet as we need to determine if a statement should
	be done in parallel or not.

2005-12-02 06:03  phase1geo

	Adding support for excluding functions, tasks and named blocks. 
	Added tests to regression suite to verify this support.  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-01 23:46  phase1geo

	Fixing compile errors when HAVE_TCLTK is defined in config.h.

2005-12-01 16:17  phase1geo

	Adding new diagnostics to test exclusion properties of modules,
	functions, tasks and named_blocks.  Full regression fails at this
	point with most of new diagnostics.

2005-12-01 15:11  phase1geo

	Adding more error checking diagnostics into regression suite.  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-01 14:49  phase1geo

	Adding nested_block3 to verify nested named blocks in tasks.  Fixed
	named block usage to be FUNC_CALL or TASK_CALL -like based on its
	placement.

2005-12-01 13:46  phase1geo

	Removed Tcl/Tk from source files if HAVE_TCLTK is not defined.

2005-12-01 12:35  phase1geo

	Fixing bug where functions in continuous assignments could cause
	the assignment to constantly be reevaluated (infinite looping). 
	Added new nested_block2 diagnostic to verify nested named blocks in
	functions.  Also verifies that nested named blocks can call
	functions in the same module.  Also modified NB_CALL expressions to
	act like functions (no context switching involved).  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-01 10:08  phase1geo

	Allowing nested functional units within a module to get parsed and
	handled correctly.  Added new nested_block1 diagnostic to test
	nested named blocks -- will add more tests later for different
	combinations.  Updated regression suite which now passes.

2005-11-30 12:25  phase1geo

	Fixing named block code.  Full regression now passes.  Still more
	work to do on named blocks, however.

2005-11-29 17:14  phase1geo

	Adding support for named blocks.  Still not working at this point
	but checkpointing anyways.  Added new task3.1 diagnostic to verify
	task removal when a task is calling another task.

2005-11-29 13:04  phase1geo

	Adding tests to verify task functionality.  Updating failing tests
	and fixed bugs for context switch expressions at the end of a
	statement block, statement block removal for missing function/tasks
	and thread killing.

2005-11-29 09:02  phase1geo

	Adding task3 diagnostic to regression suite.

2005-11-28 17:28  phase1geo

	Checkpointing with additions for threads.

2005-11-28 12:31  phase1geo

	Fixing memory fault bug in expression deallocation algorithm.

2005-11-27 23:45  phase1geo

	Adding new task diagnostics to regression suite.

2005-11-25 16:03  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in race condition checker when racing statement blocks
	are in different functional units.  Still some work to do here with
	what to do when conflicting statement block is in a task/function
	(I suppose we need to remove the calling statement block as well?)

2005-11-25 10:48  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in binding algorithm.  Full regression now passes.

2005-11-23 17:10  phase1geo

	Updating TODO.

2005-11-23 17:05  phase1geo

	Updating regression files.  Full regression now passes.

2005-11-23 17:03  phase1geo

	Fixing statement block removal to do it after binding and race
	condition checking.

2005-11-22 17:03  phase1geo

	Adding support for event trigger mechanism.  Regression is
	currently broke due to these changes -- we need to remove statement
	blocks that contain triggers that are not simulated.

2005-11-22 10:46  phase1geo

	Fixed bug with clearing the assigned bit in the binding phase. 
	Full regression now runs cleanly.

2005-11-21 23:30  phase1geo

	Updates to regression suite for clearing the assigned bit when a
	statement block is removed from coverage consideration and it is
	assigning that signal.	This is not fully working at this point.

2005-11-21 17:31  phase1geo

	Adding support for initial statement blocks.  Added first initial1
	diagnostic to regression suite.  This support seems to be working
	for the moment -- still need to run regressions.

2005-11-21 16:21  phase1geo

	More regression updates.  Also made some updates to debugging
	output.

2005-11-20 22:37  phase1geo

	Miscellaneous updates.

2005-11-20 22:17  phase1geo

	More updates to regression suite -- includes several bug fixes. 
	Also added --enable-debug facility to configuration file which will
	include or exclude debugging output from being generated.

2005-11-18 17:52  phase1geo

	More regression cleanup -- still quite a few errors to handle here.

2005-11-17 23:17  phase1geo

	Updating regressions with latest round of changes.  Also added
	bit-fill capability to expression_assign function -- still more
	changes to come.  We need to fix the expression sizing problem for
	RHS expressions of assignment operators.

2005-11-17 17:35  phase1geo

	Blocking assignment is now working properly along with support for
	event expressions (currently only the original PEDGE, NEDGE, AEDGE
	and DELAY are supported but more can now follow).  Added new race4
	diagnostic to verify that a register cannot be assigned from more
	than one location -- this works.  Regression fails at this point.

2005-11-16 23:34  phase1geo

	Initial work on supporting blocking assignments.  Added new
	diagnostic to check that this initial work is working correctly. 
	Quite a bit more work to do here.

2005-11-16 17:02  phase1geo

	Added new diagnostics to check for functions that contain
	time-consuming expressions (this is not allowed by Covered -- and
	not by most commercial simulators either).  Updated check_test to
	do error checking and added error outputs.  Full regression passes
	at this point -- 225 diagnostics.

2005-11-16 16:07  phase1geo

	Now full regression runs without error.

2005-11-16 16:01  phase1geo

	Fixing more problems related to simulation of function/task calls. 
	Regression runs are now running without errors.

2005-11-16 13:47  phase1geo

	Updating VCS-only diagnostic files.

2005-11-15 23:50  phase1geo

	Fixing binding with merge command.

2005-11-15 23:41  phase1geo

	Fixing implicit signal creation in binding functions.

2005-11-15 17:08  phase1geo

	Updates for new binding scheme.  Binding occurs for all
	expressions, signals, FSMs, and functional units after parsing has
	completed or after database reading has been completed.  This
	should allow for any hierarchical reference or scope issues to be
	handled correctly.  Regression mostly passes but there are still a
	few failures at this point.  Checkpointing.

2005-11-11 17:29  phase1geo

	Checkpointing some work in progress.  This will cause compile
	errors.  In the process of moving db read expression signal binding
	from vsignal output to expression output so that we can just call
	the binder in the expression_db_read function.

2005-11-11 16:53  phase1geo

	Updated bind process to allow binding of structures from different
	hierarchies.  Added task port signals to get added.

2005-11-10 17:27  phase1geo

	Adding scope files to handle scope searching.  The functions are
	complete (not debugged) but are not as of yet used anywhere in the
	code.  Added new func2 diagnostic which brings out scoping issues
	for functions.

2005-11-10 13:28  phase1geo

	Updates/fixes for tasks/functions.  Also updated Tcl/Tk scripts for
	these changes.	Fixed bug with net_decl_assign statements -- the
	line, start column and end column information was incorrect,
	causing problems with the GUI output.

2005-11-08 17:11  phase1geo

	Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these
	structures; however, regressions now pass again so we are
	checkpointing here.

2005-06-23 11:06  phase1geo

	Updating report files due to extra space for module/instance name.

2005-06-15 17:13  phase1geo

	Updates to include signal callbacks and integration with Covered's
	simulation core.

2005-06-10 17:26  phase1geo

	Adding symlinks to needed files.

2005-06-10 15:50  phase1geo

	Initial addition of vpi source files (just trying to get them into
	the database for now).

2005-05-11 07:39  phase1geo

	Removed vpi_user.h to allow us to work with other simulators or
	other versions of Icarus Verilog.

2005-05-08 22:08  phase1geo

	Intermediate checkin for VPI changes.  Also contains parser fix
	which should be branch applied to the latest stable and development
	versions.

2005-05-02 10:38  phase1geo

	Potential fix for older release backward compatibility.

2005-05-02 10:33  phase1geo

	Updates.

2005-05-02 00:00  phase1geo

	Start of adding VPI support to Covered.  Still a ways to go at this
	point.

2005-03-04 23:16  phase1geo

	Adding patch to parser.y to fix compiling problems with parser.y
	via bison-2.0.

2005-02-16 07:44  phase1geo

	Adding value propagation function to vsignal.c and adding this
	propagation to BASSIGN expression assignment after the assignment
	occurs.

2005-02-11 16:58  phase1geo

	Missed a file from the last submission.

2005-02-11 16:49  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with removing statement blocks that contain statements
	that cannot currently be handled by Covered correctly.	There was a
	problem when the bad statement was the last statement in the
	statement block.  Updated regression accordingly.  Added race
	condition diagnostics that currently are not in regression due to
	lack of code support for them.	Ifdef'ed out the BASSIGN stuff for
	this checkin.

2005-02-09 08:11  phase1geo

	More code for supporting expression assignments.

2005-02-08 17:18  phase1geo

	Starting to add code to handle expression assignment for blocking
	assignments.  At this point, regressions will probably still pass
	but new code isn't doing exactly what I want.

2005-02-07 22:05  phase1geo

	Final checkin for next development release.

2005-02-07 17:47  phase1geo

	Updating NEWS and ChangeLog for upcoming development release.

2005-02-07 16:43  phase1geo

	Updating TODO.

2005-02-07 16:19  phase1geo

	Added code to output race condition reasons to informational bar. 
	Also added code to output toggle and combinational logic output to
	information bar when cursor is over an expression that, when
	clicked on, will take you to the detailed coverage window.

2005-02-07 11:37  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in process_file.tcl script where start_line and end_line
	global variables were being assigned when they should not have
	been.

2005-02-06 23:10  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in statement_get_last_line calculator.  Updated
	regression for this fix.

2005-02-05 23:15  phase1geo

	Updating TODO.

2005-02-05 23:11  phase1geo

	Adding a couple of files that were missing from last checkin.

	Updated man page.

2005-02-05 00:47  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with race condition output in instance reporting. 
	Changing default report output of race conditions to false and
	updating in-line documentation.  Added rules in regression runs for
	specifically testing race condition output.  Updated regression
	files for these changes.  Regression runs clean at this point.	We
	just need to add user documentation for the race condition feature
	add and we should be done.

2005-02-05 00:20  phase1geo

	Added ascii report output for race conditions.	There is a
	segmentation fault bug associated with instance reporting.  Need to
	look into further.

2005-02-04 23:29  phase1geo

	Added race condition reporting to GUI.

2005-02-04 22:13  phase1geo

	Started to add reporting capabilities for race condition
	information.  Modified race condition reason calculation and
	handling.  Ran -Wall on all code and cleaned things up.  Cleaned up
	regression as a result of these changes.  Full regression now
	passes.

2005-02-04 17:55  phase1geo

	Adding code to support race condition information in CDD files. 
	All code is now in place for writing/reading this data to/from the
	CDD file (although nothing is currently done with it and it is
	currently untested).

2005-02-04 13:38  phase1geo

	Adding new race condition checking diagnostics.  Updated all
	regression diagnostics that failed with new changes to remove race
	condition code.  Regression now runs cleanly will all race
	condition checking code.

2005-02-02 23:50  phase1geo

	Updating TODO file.

2005-02-02 23:48  phase1geo

	assignments in statement block.  Regression still runs clean.

2005-01-27 07:33  phase1geo

	Added code to calculate if statement block is sequential,
	combinational, both or none.

2005-01-25 07:59  phase1geo

	Adding race1.2 to regression suite.

2005-01-25 07:42  phase1geo

	Fixing segmentation fault problem with race condition checking. 
	Added race1.1 to regression.  Removed unnecessary output statements
	from previous debugging checkins.

2005-01-24 07:21  phase1geo

	Modifying unlinking algorithm for statement links.  Still getting
	segmentation fault at this time.

2005-01-11 08:24  phase1geo

	Intermediate checkin.

2005-01-10 17:23  phase1geo

	Adding race1 diagnostic to regression suite.

2005-01-10 17:03  phase1geo

	Added code to properly report race conditions.	Added code to
	remove statement blocks from module when race conditions are found.

2005-01-10 07:47  phase1geo

	Adding race1 test into testsuite (though this is not part of the
	regression suite yet).	Updating CDD files for latest changes.

2005-01-10 07:44  phase1geo

	Fixing case where signal selects are being assigned by different
	statements that do not overlap.  We do not have race conditions in
	this case.

2005-01-09 20:59  phase1geo

	Code added for race condition checking that checks for signals
	being assigned in multiple statements.	Working on handling bit
	selects -- this is in progress.

2005-01-07 17:29  phase1geo

	Adding ability to handle strings in expressions.  Added string1.v
	diagnostic to verify this functionality.  Updated regressions for
	this change.

2005-01-07 16:59  phase1geo

	Regression now passes for previous changes.  Also added ability to
	properly convert quoted strings to vectors and vectors to quoted
	strings.  This will allow us to support strings in expressions. 
	This is a known good.

2005-01-07 11:59  phase1geo

2004-09-06 22:50  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with underlines going bezerk when switching between
	expressions.

2004-09-06 22:17  phase1geo

	Things look and work pretty well at this point.

2004-08-17 10:23  phase1geo

	Added combinational logic coverage output to GUI.  Modified comb.c
	code to get this to work that impacts ASCII coverage output;
	however, regression is fully passing with these changes. 
	Combinational coverage for GUI is mostly complete regarding
	information and usability.  Possibly some cleanup in output and in
	code is needed.

2004-08-16 23:43  phase1geo

	Updating unary and binary combinational expression output functions
	to create string arrays instead of immediately sending the
	information to standard output to support GUI interface as well as
	ASCII interface.

2004-08-16 15:46  phase1geo

	Fixing problem where canceled file openings were acting badly. 
	Also added window and scrollbars for coverage information (although
	this information is not specified here yet).  Also added new global
	variable that reports the current expression to get coverage
	information for (this will be added next).  GUI is operating as
	desired and without errors at this point.

2004-08-16 13:54  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in last checkin and added underline ID information to
	expression structure for recalling coverage information.

	 Able to move up and down underline tree correctly.

2004-08-16 00:07  phase1geo

	Adding more for displaying combinational logic underlines as
	desired.  Expressions are now (mostly) organized correctly.  Still
	need to determine which expression has been selected and need to
	display only expressions that are selected.

2004-08-13 17:05  phase1geo

	Work in progress on cleaning up combinational expression output.

2004-08-13 15:45  phase1geo

	More added for combinational logic verbose reporting.  At this
	point, the code is being output with underlines that can move up
	and down the expression tree.  No expression reporting is being
	done at this time, however.

2004-08-12 07:56  phase1geo

	Fixing error in combinational logic collection function for covered
	logic.

2004-08-11 17:11  phase1geo

	Initial beginnings of combinational logic verbose reporting to GUI.

2004-08-10 13:28  phase1geo

	Adding code to keep textbox output in main window the same when
	switching between different coverage types.

2004-08-10 12:23  phase1geo

	Fixing various user-related problems with interface.  Things are
	working pretty well at this point, I believe.

2004-08-10 10:58  phase1geo

	Fixing problems with toggle coverage when modules start on lines
	above 1 and problems when signal is a single or multi-bit select.

2004-08-10 09:28  phase1geo

	Removing diags and doc directories fro Makefile.am and fixing
	toggle.tcl to work as wanted.

	Removing packages and images directory from build path since these
	no longer exist.

2004-08-08 07:50  phase1geo

	Snapshot of addition of toggle coverage in GUI.  This is not
	working exactly as it will be, but it is getting close.

2004-07-21 23:43  phase1geo

	Finishing code to calculate start and end columns of expressions. 
	Regression has been updated for these changes.	Other various minor
	changes as well.

2004-04-21 00:14  phase1geo

	Adding report_gui checking to print_output and adding error handler
	to TCL scripts.  Any errors occurring within the code will be
	propagated to the user.

2004-04-19 17:16  phase1geo

	Fixing syntax error from last change.

2004-04-19 08:42  phase1geo

	Forgot to modify replace function for column information.

2004-04-18 23:54  phase1geo

	Adding replace and merge options to file menu.

2004-04-07 06:36  phase1geo

	Changes made to allow opening multiple CDD files without needing to
	deallocate all memory for one before reallocating memory for
	another.  Things are not entirely working at this point.

2004-04-05 07:30  phase1geo

	Adding *db_replace functions to allow a design to be opened with
	new CDD results (for GUI purposes only).

2004-04-03 19:35  phase1geo

	Adding ability to hold place in textbox when switching
	background/foreground colors and coverage types.  Added labels
	above module/instance listbox and text box (removing "Line #" and
	"Verilog Source" from text window).  Making information label
	normal (not sunken) because the sunken affords user interaction.

2004-04-02 13:37  phase1geo

	Updating CVS 0_2_2 branch with changes since 0.2 release.  Also
	renaming signal to vsignal in release to fix bug where some OS's
	have a signal.h in the /usr/include directory that get compiled in
	with the unistd.h included by util.c.  This is the prelude to the
	0.2.3 stable release.  Updated NEWS.

2004-04-01 22:46  phase1geo

	Fixing message box for file opening.  This is now working
	correctly.  Added "Reopen CDD" command to File menu for future use.
	 Disabling "Open CDD..." command after file has been opened (since
	we cannot have more than one CDD file open currently).	Add message
	to info bar to tell user to select a module/instance name to see
	coverage results.

2004-04-01 16:54  phase1geo

	Making text field read-only.  Adding message when reading in new
	CDD files (as status information -- this is not working correctly
	yet).  Fixing bug in line.c when getting total lines summary
	information.

	problems on systems that contain a signal type in the OS.

2004-03-29 16:47  phase1geo

	Causing module/instance listbox to not resize when window size is
	increased.  At some point we will want to figure out how to make
	this window resizable.

2004-03-28 23:01  phase1geo

	Adding information bar to bottom of window.  Populating it with
	filename of selected module/instance when display coverage
	information.

2004-03-23 07:43  phase1geo

	Modifications to Makefile structure to install TCL scripts in
	location that is known to Covered without the use of a COVERED_HOME
	environment variable.  We are almost there now.

2004-03-22 07:26  phase1geo

	Updates for upcoming release.  We are not quite ready to release at
	this point.

2004-03-20 21:56  phase1geo

	Updating multi_exp2 reports to match current version of comb.c.  At
	some time we will get comb.c fixed to match the previous version.

2004-03-20 09:26  phase1geo

	Fixing assertion error in report command for multi-value expression
	display.  Added multi_exp3 report information to regression suite

	that is not fully covered.

2004-03-18 17:01  phase1geo

	Fixing combination_output_expr function to correctly determine when
	an expression should be output to the report.  Full regression now
	passes.  Also modified TCL scripts to not be dependent on the
	original widgets package (we use straight TCL for now).

2004-03-18 08:06  phase1geo

	Fixing combination_output_expr to work correctly for covered and
	uncovered modes.

2004-03-17 22:43  phase1geo

	Cleaning up verbose output.  The last modification still isn't
	working exactly as hoped; more work to do here.

2004-03-17 17:04  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix output problem when -c option is specified for
	expressions that contain non-measurable subexpressions.

	and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL
	files).

2004-03-15 15:38  phase1geo

	Adding example.v diagnostic for documentation purposes.

2004-01-31 12:57  phase1geo

	Finished reformatting of reports.  Fixed bug where merged reports
	with different leading hierarchies were outputting the leading
	hierarchy of one which lead to confusion when interpreting reports.
	 Also made modification to information line in CDD file for these
	cases.	Full regression runs clean with Icarus Verilog at this
	point.

2004-01-30 17:23  phase1geo

	More report output improvements.  Still not ready with regressions.

2004-01-30 00:04  phase1geo

	More report output format tweaks.  Adjusted lines and spaces to
	make things look more organized.  Still some more to go. 
	Regression will fail at this point.

2004-01-28 11:05  phase1geo

	Changing toggle report information from binary output format to
	hexidecimal output format for ease in readability for large signal
	widths.  Updated regression for this change and added new toggle.v
	diagnostic to verify these changes.

2004-01-28 11:01  phase1geo

	multi_exp2.1.v, respectively.  Added these new diagnostics to the
	regression suite.

2004-01-27 07:34  phase1geo

	Working version of combinational logic report output but I still
	want to clean this code up.

2004-01-26 13:09  phase1geo

	Fixes to comb.c for last checkin.  We are not quite there yet with
	the output quality for comb.c but we are close.  Next round of
	changes for comb.c should do the trick.

2004-01-25 23:39  phase1geo

	Initial swag at new underline ID algorithm.  This not quite working
	correctly at this time.  Added two generic diagnostics to
	regression suite that will test this new capability.

2004-01-24 21:40  phase1geo

	Fixes bugs in summary information not matching verbose information.
	 Also fixes bugs where instances were output when no logic was
	missing, where instance children were missing but not output. 
	Changed code to output summary information on a per instance basis
	(where children instances are not merged into parent instance
	summary information).  Updated regressions as a result.  Updates to
	user documentation (though this is not complete at this time).

	regression fails with this fix.

2004-01-21 16:26  phase1geo

	Changed default CDD file name from "cov.db" to "cov.cdd".  Changed

2002-09-26 20:19  phase1geo

	Fixed problems with parameter overriding from command-line.  This
	now works and param1.2.v has been added to test this functionality.
	 Totally reworked regression running to allow each diagnostic to
	specify unique command-line arguments to Covered.  Full regression
	passes.

2002-09-26 17:58  phase1geo

	Fixing syntax error.

2002-09-26 17:57  phase1geo

	Added parameter tests to verify supported functionality.  Full
	regression passes.

2002-09-25 23:17  phase1geo

	Adding support for expressions in parameter definitions. 
	param1.1.v added to test simple functionality of this and it passes
	regression.

2002-09-25 17:41  phase1geo

	Adding diagnostics to check missing concatenation cases that
	uncovered bugs in testing other codes.	Also fixed case in report
	command for summary information.  The combinational logic
	information was not being reported correctly for summary reports.

2002-09-25 13:56  phase1geo

	Adding diagnostic to verify that Covered does the correct thing
	with concatenations on the left-hand side of an equation.

2002-09-25 00:38  phase1geo

	Cleaning things up a bit.

2002-09-25 00:36  phase1geo

	Initial version of parameter support is now in place.  Parameters
	work on a basic level.	param1.v tests this basic functionality and
	param1.cdd contains the correct CDD output from handling parameters
	in this file.  Yeah!

2002-09-24 21:51  phase1geo

	Removing need of vector nibble array allocation and deallocation
	during expression resizing for efficiency and bug reduction.  Other
	enhancements for parameter support.  Parameter stuff still not
	quite complete.

2002-09-22 20:37  phase1geo

	Need to make some changes to the inst_parm structure and some
	associated functionality for efficiency purposes.  This checkin
	contains most of the changes to the parser (with the exception of
	signal sizing).

2002-09-21 02:03  phase1geo

	Attached all parameter functions into db.c.  Just need to finish
	getting parser to correctly add override parameters.  Once this is
	complete, phase 3 can start and will include regenerating
	expressions and signals before getting output to CDD file.

2002-09-20 23:11  phase1geo

	Completed phase 1 for adding in parameter support.  Main code is
	written that will create an instance parameter from a given module
	parameter in its entirety.  The next step will be to complete the
	module parameter creation code all the way to the parser. 
	Regression still passes and everything compiles at this point.

2002-09-19 18:51  phase1geo

	Separating VCS and Icarus Verilog regression runs to make running
	with either compiler more simple and allows sharing of previously
	generated CDD files.  Full regression passes.

	this point.

2002-09-18 21:50  phase1geo

	Causing previously assigned bit to not get set when value does not
	change.  This is necessary to support different Verilog compiler
	approaches to displaying initial values of undefined signals.

2002-09-12 00:16  phase1geo

	Updating all CDD files in regression suite due to change in vector
	handling.  Modified vectors to assign a default value of 0xaa to
	unassigned registers to eliminate bugs where values never assigned
	and VCD file doesn't contain information for these.  Added initial
	working version of depth feature in report generation.	Updates to
	man page and parameter documentation.

2002-09-10 00:40  phase1geo

	Adding support for MULTIPLY, DIVIDE and MOD in expression verbose
	display.  Fixing cases where -c option was not generating covered
	information in line and combination report output.  Updates to

	Covered and IVerilog.  Updated assign1.cdd to account for correct
	coverage file for the updated assign1.v diagnostic.

2002-09-05 22:05  phase1geo

	Some ideas about handling parameters have been added to these
	files.	Added "Special Thanks" section in User's Guide for
	acknowledgements to people helping in project.

2002-08-27 06:53  phase1geo

	Adding more code for parameter support.  Moving parameters from
	being a part of modules to being a part of instances and calling

	default behavior of displaying uncovered logic.  This is useful for
	debugging purposes and understanding what logic the tool is capable
	of handling.

2002-08-19 23:05  phase1geo

	Adding UNUSED_IDENTIFIER to list_of_variables definition to catch
	cases where a list of variables is inside a structure that is not

	Modifying regression output and updating CDD files due to recent
	fixes.

2002-08-18 23:34  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in database reading code that dealt with merging

	Added ability to create implicit signals for local signals.  Added
	implicit1.v diagnostic to test for correctness.  Full regression
	passes.  Other tweaks to output information.

2002-07-20 16:34  phase1geo

	Separating ability to parse design and score dumpfile.	Now both or
	either can be done (allowing one to parse once and score multiple
	times).

2002-07-20 15:48  phase1geo

	Fixing a bug that caused the same file to be added to the use_files
	list more than once.  A filename will only appear once in this list
	now.  Updates to the TODO list.

2002-07-20 13:46  phase1geo

	It could be that the design and VCD file do not match.

2002-07-13 00:23  phase1geo

	Major improvements to VCD scoping.  With these changes, Covered can
	read in a VCD file that contains scopes that are not used in the
	design, ignore unused scopes and use scopes that are found in its
	database.  Additionally, there was a major performance improvement
	for larger designs for VCD file reading (simulation time has
	improved).

2002-07-12 23:09  phase1geo

	Modified a lot of code this go around.	Fixed VCD reader to handle
	changes in the reverse order (last changes are stored instead of
	first for timestamp).  Fixed problem with AEDGE operator to handle
	vector value changes correctly.  Added casez2.v diagnostic to
	verify proper handling of casez with '?' characters.  Full
	regression passes; however, the recent changes seem to have
	impacted performance -- need to look into this.

	Small update to CASE handling in scope to avoid future errors.

2002-07-04 19:10  phase1geo

	Adding report support for case statements.  Everything outputs
	fine; however, I want to remove CASE, CASEX and CASEZ expressions
	from being reported since it causes redundant and misleading
	information to be displayed in the verbose reports.  New
	diagnostics to check CASE expressions have been added and pass.

2002-07-04 18:10  phase1geo

	Added proper support for case, casex, and casez statements in score
	command.  Report command still incorrect for these statement types.

	Various bug fixes.  Added support for multiple signals sharing the
	same VCD symbol.  Changed conditional support to allow proper
	simulation results.  Updated VCD parser to allow for symbols
	containing only alphanumeric characters.

2002-07-02 13:39  phase1geo

	Adding new diagnostic to verify all expressions in assign
	statements.

2002-07-01 10:14  phase1geo

	Adding CDD directory for comparing during regression.  The CDD
	files in the CDD directory match up with the Verilog diagnostic
	names.	The output from running regression are compared to these
	CDD files.  All CDD files in this directory are known to be good.

2002-07-01 10:12  phase1geo

	Updates to Makefile for regression purposes.  Still missing the
	automatic checking portion of the regression run.

2002-07-01 10:10  phase1geo

	Fixing always loopbacks and setting stop bits correctly.  All
	verilog diagnostics seem to be passing with these fixes.

2002-06-30 17:23  phase1geo

	Working on fixing looping in parser.  Statement connector needs to
	be revamped.

2002-06-28 23:51  phase1geo

	Various fixes for bugs found in regression testing.

2002-06-28 23:50  phase1geo

	Added new diagnostic to test always.  This diagnostic is not
	running properly yet do to missing code to handle CDD reading of
	cyclic statement trees.

2002-06-27 22:05  phase1geo

	Removing assign.v diagnostic from pool.  Updates to Makefile.

2002-06-27 22:04  phase1geo

	Fixing more errors found by diagnostics.  Things are running pretty
	well at this point with current diagnostics.  Still some report
	output problems.

2002-06-27 19:40  phase1geo

	Cleaning up extraneous output from debugging.

2002-06-27 16:18  phase1geo

	Fixing report Verilog output.  simple.v verilog diagnostic now
	passes.

2002-06-27 15:40  phase1geo

	Adding delays to simple.v for better testing of existing code. 
	Small modification to Makefile to make it more generic.

2002-06-27 15:39  phase1geo

	Fixing scoring bugs as well as report bugs.  Things are starting to
	work fairly well now.  Added rest of support for delays.

2002-06-27 07:36  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs with scoring.  I think I got it this time.

2002-06-26 17:09  phase1geo

	Removing unecessary output and updating regression Makefile.

2002-06-25 23:59  phase1geo

	Adding initial support for delays.  Support is not yet complete and
	is currently untested.

2002-06-25 22:45  phase1geo

	Fixing more bugs in simulator and report functions.  About to add
	support for delay statements.

2002-06-25 16:46  phase1geo

	Fixes to simulator and reporting.  Still some bugs here.

2002-06-25 07:48  phase1geo

	Fixing case where statement's true and false paths point to itself
	when reading in CDD.

2002-06-25 07:26  phase1geo

	Added unused types into parser.  These unused types mimic their
	"in-use" counterparts but are used in situations where we do not
	want to store its information for processing.  This removes the
	need to allocate and deallocate memory for unused logic.

2002-06-24 22:39  phase1geo

	Fixed initial scoring bugs.  We now generate a legal CDD file for
	reporting.  Fixed some report bugs though there are still some
	remaining.

2002-06-24 21:02  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs with writing/reading statements and with parsing design
	with statements.  We now get to the scoring section.  Some problems
	here at the moment with the simulator.

2002-06-24 07:34  phase1geo

	Fixing the set of the STMT_HEAD and STMT_STOP bits.  We are getting
	close.

2002-06-23 23:54  phase1geo

	More fixes and code additions to make statements work properly. 
	Still not there at this point.

2002-06-23 16:18  phase1geo

	Added appropriate statement support in parser.	All parts should be
	in place and ready to start testing.

2002-06-22 16:08  phase1geo

	Added simulation engine and tied it to the db.c file.  Simulation
	engine is currently untested and will remain so until the parser is
	updated correctly for statements.  This will be the next step.

2002-06-22 00:27  phase1geo

	Additional supporting code for simulation engine and statement
	support in parser.

2002-06-21 00:55  phase1geo

	Getting some codes ready for writing simulation engine.  We should
	be set now.

2002-06-18 21:25  phase1geo

	Moving documentation around.  Adding start of developer's
	documentation.

2002-06-01 00:22  phase1geo

	Adding files for user's document.  These are generated by the
	Manstyle utility.

2002-06-01 00:18  phase1geo

	Adding files created from the manstyle utility for creating user's
	manual.

2002-05-12 22:02  phase1geo

	Adding lines back to expressions and removing them from statements
	(since the line number range of an expression can be calculated by
	looking at the expression line numbers).

2002-05-02 22:39  phase1geo

	Removing all syntax errors due to addition of statements.  Added
	more statement support code.  Still have a ways to go before we can
	try anything.  Removed lines from expressions though we may want to
	consider putting these back for reporting purposes.

2002-05-01 22:27  phase1geo

	Initial creation of statement structure and manipulation files. 
	Internals are still in a chaotic state.

2002-04-30 00:04  phase1geo

	Added initial go-round of adding statement handling to parser. 
	Added simple Verilog test to check correct statement handling.	At
	this point there is a bug in the expression write function (we need
	to display statement trees in the proper order since they are
	unlike normal expression trees.)

2002-04-29 16:58  phase1geo

	Starting to add suggested statement expression support to run-time
	engine.  This is not completed yet at this point.

2002-04-28 21:42  phase1geo

	Starting to add support for statements.  Added support for bit-wise
	coverage for combinational coverage instead of requiring a 1-bit
	expression to be measurable.  Not turned on at this point in the
	reporting, but is present in the scoring engine.

2002-04-27 00:04  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs 548895 and 549311.	Also added rest of initial support
	for combinational logic verbose reporting.  Works for small set of
	examples.

2002-04-25 21:21  phase1geo

	Making VCD parser more verbose to handle VCD syntax that Icarus
	Verilog doesn't generate but other VCD outputs do.  Also fixing bug
	with underlining output.

2002-04-25 08:35  phase1geo

	Fixing bug that allowed a parent expression to only be one bit wide
	when its children were larger.	Other subtle fixes with report
	output.

2002-04-24 22:37  phase1geo

	Removed op field from expression structure and moved it to the
	supplemental field in the structure.  This lessens the memory
	required for an expression by 4 bytes.	Updated all code
	accordingly and regenerated automatic documentation.

2002-04-23 11:15  phase1geo

	Removing unused files

2002-04-23 10:03  phase1geo

	Removing Makefile from CVS repository in src directory.  Fixing
	percent sign output for summary reporting.

2002-04-23 00:27  phase1geo

	Finished first go-round with the combinational logic verbose
	output.  Still a few bugs and quite a bit of missing functionality
	in this area.

2002-04-22 20:22  phase1geo

	Cleaning up the output for line, toggle and combinational
	reporting.  Fixed bug in toggle verbose function where hit01 and
	hit10 were not getting cleared before being set in the
	vector_toggle_count function which kept untoggled signals from
	being output on the verbose report.

2002-04-22 20:04  phase1geo

	Fixed initial bugs in underlining code.  This seems to be working
	correctly at this point.

2002-04-22 08:31  phase1geo

	Started to fix some bugs in the underline code.  Not finished with
	the bug fixes at this time.

2002-04-22 00:00  phase1geo

	Modified assign diagnostic to change coverage results.	Added check
	for TRUE/FALSE of expression for proper underlining.

2002-04-21 23:46  phase1geo

	Adding initial code for combination verbose output.  This code is
	not fully debugged and is missing some important features at this
	point.

2002-04-20 00:55  phase1geo

	Adding combinational logic reporting.  At this point nothing has
	been debugged and module verbose outputting is missing for
	combinations.  Also need to add the output for combinational
	misses.

2002-04-19 16:25  phase1geo

	Added toggle verbose outputting support

2002-04-18 23:40  phase1geo

	Removing file since it is not needed in CVS

2002-04-18 22:07  phase1geo

	Initial creation of Covered project.

2002-04-18 22:07  phase1geo

	Initial revision
