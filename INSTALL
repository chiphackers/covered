                              COVERED
                   User Installation Instructions
===================================================================

1.  Supported Systems
  Covered has been mostly tested on a RedHat Linux 7.2 system.  Limited testing
  has been done on IRIX-6.5.12.  The intent of this tool is to support any
  POSIX standard environment.  The Icarus Verilog simulator has been used extensively
  throughout the development process.  VCS has also been used in testing.

2.  Required Tools
  The following is a list of tools that are necessary for building/compiling the
  Covered executable.
  - gcc  (Version 2.96 -- not sure if >=3.0 versions will work yet)
  - flex (Version 2.5.4 -- later versions are known to not work yet)
  - bison (Version 1.28 or higher)
  - GNU make (Version 3.27.1 or higher)
  - GNU gperf (Version 2.7.2 or higher)
  - TCL (Version 8.3 or higher)
  - TK (Version 8.3 or higher)

  If you would like to use LXT2 formatted dumpfiles with Covered, you now may but
  it will additionally require you to have the following library package:
  - zlib-devel

  Additionally, the development documentation is built using the doxygen utility
  which can be found at http://www.doxygen.org

3.  Configure and Make Process
  To begin with, untar and ungzip the Covered tarball with the following command:

    gzip -dc <Covered tarball name> | tar xvf -

  After this has completed, cd to the Covered directory and perform the following
  command to build the proper Makefiles and set configuration settings for your system.

    ./configure

  If you are debugging a memory allocation failure and would like to use the mpatrol
  library to accomplish this (please see development documentation for more information),
  you will need to remove the "dnl" comment in the configure.in file, run aclocal and
  autoconf, and finally use the following configure command instead.  Once these steps have
  been completed and the source code is compiled and run, an mpatrol.log file will be 
  generated in the run directory.  This log file is used to understand memory usage for 
  the program.

    ./configure --with-mpatrol

  If you would like to see the built-in debugging information that Covered can produce
  while it runs a command, you will need to specify the following configuration command:

    ./configure --enable-debug

  After configure has been called and 'make' run, you can get the Covered debug information
  generated to standard output by specifying the global '-D' option (see 'covered -h' for more
  information) with any command.

  After the configuration process has completed, a Makefile will be created in the
  Covered directory.  To build and compile all source code for the tool, simply type:

    make

  This will create the "covered" executable file in the ./src directory.  This is the
  only program that will be needed since there is no run-time linking or underlying
  libraries supporting the program.  To install the executable, simply type:

    make install

  This will install the Covered executable into the /usr/local/bin directory.  To place
  this executable in a different location, please use the --prefix=<directory> option
  when calling the ./configure script.

If there are any problems with installing Covered, please let me know by either submitting
a bug report or sending me an e-mail at phase1geo@gmail.com
