The following items are known to be problems in the current code that need to be fixed
or features that are unimplemented/not complete that need to be done before 0.3 stable
release can be made.

Legend
------
X   = This feature/fix has been completed and tested
IP  = In Progress

Score command
-------------
1.  Add ability for user to specify FSM all possible states/state transitions
    for a particular FSM on a command-line basis.

X  2.  Add ability for user to specify FSM location and all possible states/state
      transitions for a particular FSM using inline $attribute calls.

3.  Add ability to automatically extract all possible states/state transitions
    for a specified FSM.

4.  Add ability to automatically locate and extract an FSM from the design
    without user intervention.

IP 5.  Work on increasing performance of score command.

6.  Add more Verilog-2001 constructs to parser.

7.  Allow Covered to run simulation phases in parallel to increase performance.

8.  Add feature to cause Covered to omit the simulation phase for toggle and
    FSM coverage results.

Merge command
-------------


Report command
--------------

1.  Update look of text reports to make them more robust and comprehensible.

2.  Work on GUI interface for report function.

Miscellaneous
-------------

1.  Add regression that produces known, achievable error conditions in the code.
