The following items are known to be problems in the current code that need to be fixed
or features that are unimplemented/not complete that need to be done before 0.1 stable
release can be made.

Legend
------
X   = This feature/fix has been completed and tested
IP  = In Progress

Score command
-------------

IP 1.  Verify that single and multi-bit selectors work in all cases.

X  2.  When `include is encountered, store current line number in stack for retrieval
       when file parsing is resumed for that file.

   3.  When parser error occurs, output something more meaningful (for debugging purposes)
       and cause tool to exit rather than continue on.

   4.  Add performance monitor facility and attach monitors to all parser and lexer rules.

IP 5.  Handle parameters

X  6.  Verify that -D option works when a value is specified.

   7.  Make sure that expression widths are correct (may have to look at left-hand-side bit
       width to calculate this correctly).

X  8.  Make sure that parser only parses a file once (when it is in both in a library (-y) and
       and a -v option).

X  9.  Allow ability to only parse a design and only score a dumpfile (rather than having to
       do both everytime -- could save a lot of time in not having to reparse).

X  10. Possibly allow undeclared signals to be automatically created if not found (1-bit signal
       values -- simulators will probably do this).

X  11. Make sure that extension order is maintained for a given library path.

   12. Remove all local creations of err_msg string and just create one global version of this
       for efficiency sake.


Merge command
-------------

   1.  Set up some type of merge testsuite and verify that everything works correctly here.


Report command
--------------

   1.  Handle combination logic outputting for expression trees that have line-wrap.

   2.  Make sure that verbose line outputting is ordered for each file.

   3.  Make sure that combinational logic outputting is ordered for each file.

X  4.  Make sure that combinational table output is correct for all cases.

X  5.  Add '+' to combinational logic output for values equal to or greater than one.

X  6.  Make sure that all unnecessary output is removed from verbose output (sometimes
       modules/instances that have received 100% coverage still get some message).

X  7.  Add depth option for combination logic analyzer.

X  8.  Add option to output what has been covered (instead of what has not been covered)
