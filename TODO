The following items are known to be problems in the current code that need to be fixed
or features that are unimplemented/not complete that need to be done.

Legend
------
X   = This feature/fix has been completed and tested
IP  = In Progress

Build process
-------------


Score command
-------------
   1.  Add ability for user to specify FSM all possible states/state transitions
       for a particular FSM on a command-line basis.

   2.  Add ability to automatically extract all possible states/state transitions
       for a specified FSM.

   3.  Add ability to automatically locate and extract an FSM from the design
       without user intervention.

   4.  Add more Verilog-2001 constructs to parser.
	- config command
        - $random

   5.  Allow Covered to run simulation phases in parallel to increase performance.

   6.  Add feature to cause Covered to omit the simulation phase for toggle and
       FSM coverage results.

   7.  Add SystemVerilog features/syntax
IP      - typedef
IP      - struct
IP      - union
IP      - enum

X  8.  Add code pragmas to allow the user to exclude parts of design from coverage consideration.

   9.  Have Covered have the ability to generate XML CDD files.

   10. Add pragma to allow the user to ignore certain codes for race condition checking.

   11. Enhance the -rI option to allow the user to ignore certain types of race conditions.

   12. Provide ability to handle $finish and $stop system calls.


Merge command
-------------

   1.  Add ability to merge two CDDs from different parts of the same design


Report command
--------------


Miscellaneous
-------------

IP 1.  Add regression that produces known, achievable error conditions in the code.

IP 2.  Make all code splint clean.

   3.  Replace current exit strategy with cexcept usage (throw exceptions instead of immediately exiting)

   4.  Have parser generate dumpvars file to cause only needed signals by Covered to get dumped (performance enhancement).


GUI
---

X  1.  Update GUI to make interface a bit easier to use (less cluttered)

X  2.  Create GUI for Mac OS X using TclTkAquaBI
