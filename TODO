The following items are known to be problems in the current code that need to be fixed
or features that are unimplemented/not complete that need to be done.

Legend
------
X   = This feature/fix has been completed and tested
IP  = In Progress

Score command
-------------
   1.  Add ability for user to specify FSM all possible states/state transitions
       for a particular FSM on a command-line basis.

   2.  Add ability to automatically extract all possible states/state transitions
       for a specified FSM.

   3.  Add ability to automatically locate and extract an FSM from the design
       without user intervention.

   4.  Add more Verilog-1995 constructs to parser.
       - loops (for, while, repeat)
       - tasks/functions

   5.  Add more Verilog-2001 constructs to parser.

   6.  Allow Covered to run simulation phases in parallel to increase performance.

   7.  Add feature to cause Covered to omit the simulation phase for toggle and
       FSM coverage results.

   8.  Add ability to perform assignments for signals that are within modules being Covered.
       - Handle cases where a BASSIGN is performed in a statement block that is ignored/thrown away
         (we may want the VCD assignment information for this)

   9.  Fix bug for event-handling

   10. Put support in for events/triggers

   11. Finish support for tasks and named blocks

Miscellaneous
-------------

IP 1.  Add regression that produces known, achievable error conditions in the code.


GUI
---

   1.  Add FSM coverage output

   2.  Add ability to turn on/off assertions and have coverage information automatically adjusted.
  
   3.  Add summary report for entire design (window)
