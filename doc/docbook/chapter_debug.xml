  <title>Debugging</title>
  <para>
    As much as it pains the developers of Covered to admit, there will be times when a user of Covered will encounter a 
    problem in the resimulation process or will experience a performance issue during certain runs and will want to 
    investigate the issue a bit themselves before posting a bug report. There may also be people out there who just 
    might want to learn more about how Covered operates "under the hood". For those people whom I have just mentioned, 
    this section is for you.

  <sect1 id="section.debug.output">
    <title>Verbose Debug Output</title>
    <para>
      The brute force method of understanding Covered's internals is to generate verbose debug output using the global "-D" 
      option to any of Covered's commands. The user of this method should take care to note that using this option may 
      generate an <emphasis>extremely</emphasis> large amount of output and will definitely cause Covered's runtime performance 
      to degrade considerably. If this option is used, its output should probably be redirected to a file for 
      post-processing purposes. It should be noted that the verbose debug output is most useful for the developer's of 
      Covered and is not meant to be of much help to the normal user.
    </para>
    
    <sect2 id="section.debug.output.building">
      <title>Building Covered for Verbose Debug Outputting</title>
      <para>
        Because generating verbose debug output can have a tremendous degradation in performance when it is even compiled, 
        Covered requires the user to specify an option to the configuration/build process to enable this feature. To enable 
        verbose debug outputting, simply specify the <emphasis role="bold"><code>--enable-debug</code></emphasis> option to the configure 
        script. This will cause Covered to compile in verbose debug output support and enable the use of the -D global option.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          If the user has not specified the --enable-debug option to the configuration script but proceeds to specify the -D global option, 
          Covered will emit a warning message that it is unable to output verbose debug information due to the lack of the --enable-debug 
          option being specified. It will then proceed to ignore the -D option.

  <sect1 id="section.cli">
    <title>Command-Line Interface (CLI)</title>
    <para>
      As an alternative to simply outputting the verbose debug output from Covered, the score command comes equipped with its own 
      interactive debugging mechanism called the CLI (Command-Line Interface). This interface is a command-line driven utility that 
      starts at the beginning of the resimulation. Its purpose is to allow the user to step through simulation execution and view 
      the contents of signals, time, scopes, code and internal thread queues for the purposes of debugging and/or understanding 
      Covered. This utility works much in the same way as simulator CLIs and the GDB debugging utility.
    </para>
    
    <sect2 id="section.cli.building">
      <title>Building Covered for the CLI</title>
      <para>
        Because interactive command-line debugging has a small performance penalty when compiled in and is closely associated with 
        the verbose debug output option, Covered requires the user to specify an option to the configuation/build process to enable 
        this feature. To enable the CLI, simply specify the <emphasis role="bold"><code>--enable-debug</code></emphasis> option to the configure 
        script. This will cause Covered to compile in CLI capabilities and enable the user of the -cli score command option.
      </para>

    <sect2 id="section.cli.using">
      <title>Using the CLI</title>
      <para>
        To allow the score command to use the CLI for interactive resimulation, simply specify the 
        <emphasis role="bold"><code>-cli [<emphasis>filename</emphasis>]</code></emphasis> option to the score command. If filename is 
        specified to this option, the contents of this file will be parsed and executed once the score command has reached the 
        resimulation process. The contents of this file are a series of CLI commands (one command per line) in ASCII format and can be 
        automatically produced with the "<code>savehist</code>" CLI command (see below). This feature allows a user to quickly save off 
        the CLI commands made during one score run and reuse them in a subsequent score run without having to remember and manually input 
        the same commands.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once the -cli option is invoked, Covered will run the score command until it gets to the beginning of the resimulation process. 
        At this time, if the optional filename is specified, it will parse the contents of this file and execute the CLI commands found 
        there until all commands are executed. If filename was not specified, a prompt will be displayed and the resimulation execution 
        will halt until the user has specified otherwise via command-line options. After entering a command-line option, simply press 
        return to invoke that command. In the event that the command was a step, next or continue option, resimulation will resume 
        until it reaches the next stop point.

      The built-in source code profiling facility allows the user to run any Covered command and understand performance metrics 
      about the internal Covered source code, such as how many times a given function was called, how much wall-clock time was 
      spent executing a given function, how many times a function allocated and deallocated memory from the heap, etc. This 
      information can be useful in understanding where performance bottlenecks are during a given Covered command run. This
