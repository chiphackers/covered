        This menu option is used to either open a new CDD file or merge a related CDD file into the currently opened 
        CDD file(s).  This action needs to be performed before any coverage viewing can take place.  When this option 
        is selected, a standard file window is displayed allowing the user to select one (or possibly more depending on 
        your version of Tcl/Tk) CDD file to open or merge.  To select more than one CDD file with one call to this 
        option, simply press and hold the Control key while selecting files with the left mouse button.  If your version
        of Tcl/Tk supports this feature, you will see multiple files highlighted for selection; otherwise, only the last
        selected file will be selected.  If no CDD files currently are opened, any CDD file may be opened.  If one or
        more CDD files have been opened/merged, only CDD files generated from the same design may be merged.

        This menu option is only available after one or more CDD files have been opened/merged.  It is used to save the opened or merged 
        CDD files as a single, merged CDD file than can be viewed as a separate CDD file or can be merged with other CDD files.  It is 
        also used to save any changes that the user has made to exclude/include coverage cases within the GUI.  If you would like to 
        retain this information, please save the CDD file.  By default, the name of the first loaded CDD file is placed in the "Save As" 
        window when this option is selected. The user may choose to replace the old CDD file with the new one, or the user may save it 
        under a different name.  Once a CDD file has been saved, this option is deselected until either a new CDD file is merged or the 
        user changes the exclude/include property of any coverage case within the GUI.

        This menu option is used to close all opened/merged CDD files so that the user may view a different CDD file without needing to 
        exit and re-enter the GUI. The user may open and close as many times as needed without needing to reinvoke the GUI.  When CDD 
        files are closed, any opened coverage windows are automatically closed and all necessary GUI components are restored to their 
        original state as when the GUI is first invoked.  If the currently opened CDD file(s) have not been saved, a window (shown in 
        <xref linkend="figure.gui.main.close"/> below) is displayed to ask the user if they would like to save prior to closing.  To save 
        the CDD file, simply click "Yes" and a "Save As" window will prompt you for a location/name to save it as.  To close the CDD file 
        without saving, simply click "No".  To cancel the close operation, simply click <emphasis role="bold">Cancel</emphasis>.  To view

        A module-based report gathers all of the module instances that instantiate the same module and merges their results based on the

    <title>The Coverage Type View Bar</title>
    <para>
    <xref linkend="figure.gui.main.covbar"/> shows the location of the coverage type view bar.  The bar contains a single selection button with the currently selected
    coverage metric displayed.  There are six main types of coverage metrics that Covered can provide:  line, toggle, memory, logic (combinational logic), FSM (state 
    and arc) and assert (assertion coverage).  When the Covered GUI is first invoked, the line coverage metric is the default mode.  To view a different metric, simply 
    left click, select the desired coverage metric, and left click again.  Doing so will automatically set the selection indicator to the new mode and display the new 
    metric information in the <xref linkend="section.gui.main.listbox"/> and <xref linkend="section.gui.main.viewer"/>.

    <title>The Module/Instance Listbox</title>
    <para>
    After a CDD file has been opened in the GUI, the module/instance selection box (shown in 
    <xref linkend="figure.gui.main.listbox"/> below) will contain either a list of all of the modules within the 
    specified design or a list of all of the instances within the design, based on the type of report selected in the 
    <xref linkend="section.gui.main.reportmenu"/> menu.  Left-clicking on a module/instance name within this box will 
    cause that file to be output in the <xref linkend="section.gui.main.viewer"/> to the right of the selection box.
    </para>
    <para>
    In addition to the names of the modules or instances of the design, each line also contains a summary view of the 
    coverage for the currently selected metric for each module or instance.  The summary coverage information includes 
    the number of hits, number of misses, total number and hit percentage.  Each column in the table can be resized by 
    clicking on the separator bar between the column headers and sliding the column to the left or to the right.  
    Additionally, columns may be hidden or shown in the module/instance selection box by clicking on the button at the 
    right-hand side of the column header bar (and above the vertical scrollbar).  When this button is left-clicked, a 
    popup menu will be displayed showing which columns are currently shown (a check to the left of the column name) and 
    which are hidden (no check).  To change the display for a particular column, simply click on the column name in the 
    popup window.  This will cause the associated column to be hidden or shown and will close the popup window.  If the 
    popup window is displayed and the user does not wish to change the display values of any of the shown columns, 
    simply click anywhere on the screen but on the popup window.  This will cause the popup window to disappear and no 
    column display values will be changed.
    </para>
    <para>
    Depending on the selected coverage metric (specified in the <xref linkend="section.gui.main.covbar"/>) and the 
    coverage results for each module/instance, a module/ instance item will be highlighted in the uncovered logic color 
    if the corresponding module/instance was found to have uncovered logic within that module/instance.  If the 
    specified module/instance was found to be fully covered for the currently selected metric, it will be highlighted 
    with the selected covered logic color.  This can help the user quickly identify modules/instances that contain 
    uncovered logic cases.  Note that when a different coverage metric is selected, the highlights will be recalculated 
    for that metric.  Additionally, the currently selected module/instance will be displayed in a darker version of the 
    covered/uncovered color.

    The coverage file viewer shows the currently selected module (indicated in the

    original source code so all editing of the file must be done in a separate editor.  Each source code line in the 
    viewer window is numbered to the left of the line to aid in debugging and finding the lines in an editor.

    Depending on the coverage metric currently selected in the <xref linkend="section.gui.main.covbar"/> and the

    found to be uncovered, covered, and/or considered a race condition are highlighted in their respective color 
    schemes in the coverage file viewer window.  Using the scrollbars to the right and below the coverage file viewer, 
    the user can find the missed/hit lines quickly for further analysis.

    Additionally, the logical blocks that have been disregarded by Covered due to a potential race condition existing 
    are highlighted.  By placing the cursor over one of these logical blocks, the reason for why the logical block was 
    disregarded is output in the <xref linkend="section.gui.main.infobar"/>.

    To view a new module/instance, simply left click on one in the Module/Instance Listbox. The source code for the

    To view a new coverage metric, simply left click on one of the coverage metrics in the Coverage Type Bar.  The

      To find the next or previous line containing uncovered logic for the current metric mode, click the

      The Coverage Viewer contains a <emphasis role="bold">Find:</emphasis> button, an entry field, and a

      key or the <emphasis role="bold">Find:</emphasis> button will cause the string search to commence.

      <para>
      If a match to the search value is found, it is made visible in the Coverage File Viewer and highlighted.  The 
      user may search on the value again by clicking the <emphasis role="bold">Find:</emphasis> button.  To clear the 
      current value in the entry field, click on the <emphasis role="bold">Clear</emphasis> button.  If a match occurs, 
      the specified value in the entry field will remain until either a new value is entered or the 
      <emphasis role="bold">Clear</emphasis> button is clicked.  If a match was not found for the given string, a 
      message window will pop-up specifying that the given string was not found.  Clicking the
