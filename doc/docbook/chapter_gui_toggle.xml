  <para>
  The verbose toggle window allows the user to see which bits for a given signal have toggled from a 0-&gt;1 or a 
  1-&gt;0 during simulation. To display this window, simply click on a highlighted/underlined uncovered signal in the 
  <xref linkend="section.gui.main.viewer"/> of the main window.  This will cause the verbose toggle viewer to be created 
  for the specified signal as well as display a "--&gt;" symbol in the Coverage Viewer on the same line as the selected 
  signal.  This symbol is simply meant to help the user identify in the Coverage Viewer which signal is currently 
  displayed in the Toggle Viewer window.  <xref linkend="figure.gui.toggle"/> shows the Toggle Viewer loaded with a 
  4-bit signal called "err_vec" in which bits 3:2 have successfully toggled from a 0-&gt;1.

    The bit vector displayed is a binary bit vector, each value (0 or 1) represents whether that bit in the signal 
    either toggled (1) or did not toggle (0) during simulation.  There are two bit vectors displayed for the signal, 
    the top vector shows the 0-&gt;1 toggle information while the bottom vector shows the 1-&gt;0 toggle information.
    </para>
    <para>
    The name of the signal along with its MSB:LSB information is displayed at the bottom of the window; however, if the 
    mouse cursor is placed over a specific bit in the toggle box, the MSB:LSB will be changed to show the displayed 
    bit, making it easy for the user to discern exactly which bit has toggled/not toggled.  If the width of the signal 
    exceeds the given space for the toggle window, a scrollbar will be allowed to slide left and right to view the rest 
    of the toggle information.

    To exit this window, simply click on <emphasis role="bold">Close</emphasis> button.  To see this help page from the

    <para>
    The user may exclude/include any uncovered signal in the design for toggle coverage by simply clicking on the 
    <emphasis role="bold">Excluded</emphasis> checkbutton.  If this checkbutton is checked, the summary coverage 
    information will automatically be recalculated and redisplayed in the <xref linkend="section.gui.main.listbox"/> and 
    the background color of the underlined signal in the <xref linkend="section.gui.main.viewer"/> will change from the 
    uncovered background color to the covered background color.  However, the signal will still remain underlined, 
    allowing the user to see the verbose toggle coverage information, if necessary.  If the 
    <emphasis role="bold">Excluded</emphasis> checkbutton is unchecked, the summary coverage information and background 
    colors will be readjusted to include the coverage information for this signal.
    </para>
    <para>
    If the user excludes any signal for toggle coverage in the design, the <emphasis role="bold">Save CDD...</emphasis> 
    option in the <xref linkend="section.gui.main.filemenu"/> menu will be enabled.  This allows the user to save the 
    excluded property either back to the CDD file (or to a newly named CDD file).  Doing so will allow the user to load 
    the CDD file at a different time and retain the knowledge of which signals have been excluded/included for toggle 
    coverage.  Additionally, if a saved CDD file with coverage exclusion is merged with another CDD file, the excluded 
    signal information is preserved for the resulting merged CDD file.

    <title>Displaying a New Signal for Toggle Coverage</title>
    <para>
    If the Verbose Toggle Coverage window is currently displayed with a signal, the user may select a new signal in the 
    <xref linkend="section.gui.main.viewer"/> of the Main window.  When a new signal is selected, its value immediately 
    replaces the currently selecting signal value.  This feature allows many different signals to be viewed one after 
    the other without having to create/destroy a new window for each signal.
    </para>
    <para>
    The user may also see the previous or next uncovered signal in the main viewer by clicking either the left arrow 
    button (for previous signal viewing) or the right arrow button (for next signal viewing).  Note that the left arrow 
    button will be disabled if there is not a signal previous to the current signal in the given module and the right 
    arrow button will be disabled if there is not a signal after the current signal in the given module.
