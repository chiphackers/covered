\item[\label{_bug000001}
Member {\bf do\_\-define}() ]
This strips trailing line comments out of the definition. It's not adequate as the \char`\"{}//\char`\"{} may have been quoted or commented, but it will do for now.\end{description}


\begin{description}
\item[\label{_bug000002}
Member {\bf signal\_\-db\_\-read}(char $\ast$$\ast$line, module $\ast$curr\_\-mod) ]
A signal will only look in the current module for a matching expression. In the case of a hierarchical reference, it is possible that an expression outside the current module is referencing this signal. We need to check for this case (hierarchical expression) and find the expression elsewhere.\end{description}
