<h1>Navigating the FSM State/State Transition Coverage Window</h1>
<hr>

<p>
The Verbose FSM State/State Transition Coverage window allows the user to see which
states and state transitions of a currently selected FSM have been covered or are
uncovered.  To view this window, simply select the "FSM" coverage metric mode in the
<a href="cov_bar.html">Coverage Metric Bar</a> in the main window and select an
underlined FSM state variable in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a>.
This will cause the FSM Coverage window to be displayed with the currently selected
FSM information loaded.  Figure 1 below shows an example of this window.
</p>

<h2>Navigating the Window</h2>

<p>
The Verbose FSM window is split into two main frames.  The top frame contains the
expressions that make up the input and output states of the selected FSM.  The bottom
frame contains a two-dimensional table showing the covered and/or uncovered states and
state transitions.
</p>

<p>
The state/state transition table is a two-dimensional table with all possible values of the
input states in the left-most column, the output states in the upper-most row, and
the state transitions in the rest of the table.
</p>

<p>
To determine which states have been uncovered in the table, simply find all state values
in the input column or output row (both show the same information) which are highlighted 
with the "Uncovered" color selection specified in the
<a href="preferences.html">Preferences window</a>.  To determine which states have been
covered in the table, simply find all state values in the input column or output row which
are highlighted with the "Covered" color selection.  All other state values which are
not highlighted are either impossible values (if all of the state transitions were
specified in the Verilog file) or are unknown for coverage (if not all of the state
transitions were specified in the Verilog file).
</p>

<p>
To determine which state transitions have been uncovered in the table, simply find all
empty boxes in the table that are highlighted with the "Uncovered" background color.  If
one of these exist, it specifies that the transition of "input state" (the value
specified in the left-most column in the same row) to "output state" (the value specified
in the upper-most row in the same column) did not occur.  In the example above, we can
see that the following state transitions did not occur:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>1 -> 2</li>
  <li>3 -> 1</li>
  <li>2 -> 3</li>
  <li>2 -> 2 (loopback case)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Follow the same procedure for finding all covered state transitions in the table except
that these boxes will be highlighted with the "Covered" background color.  In the example
above, we can see that the following state transitions occurred:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>0 -> 0 (loopback case)</li>
  <li>0 -> 1</li>
  <li>1 -> 3</li>
  <li>3 -> 0</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
All other state transition boxes that are not highlighted are either impossible state
transitions (if all state transitions were specified in the Verilog source code) or
are unknown in their coverage (either not hit or impossible transition if all state
transitions were not specified in the Verilog source code).
</p>

<h2>Excluding/Including a State Transition</h2>

<p>
Uncovered state transitions can be excluded/included for FSM coverage consideration.  This
is done by clicking on the <u>I</u> (state transition is currently included in coverage
results) or <u>E</u> (state transition is currently excluded from coverage results) character 
in the middle of a state transition square.  Changing a state transition from an <u>I</u> to
an <u>E</u> will automatically cause the state transition summary coverage information in the
<a href="summary_bar.html">Main Window Summary Bar</a> to be updated and the background color
of the state transition box will change from the uncovered color to the covered color.  Changing
a state transition from an <u>E</u> to an <u>I</u> will automatically cause the state transition
summary coverage information in the Main Window Summary Bar to be updated and the background
color of the state transition box will change from the covered color to the uncovered color.
Figure 2 below shows an example of the Figure 1 state machine coverage information with a couple
of state transitions excluded from coverage. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
If all of the state transitions for a state machine have been excluded for coverage consideration,
the output state variable in the <a href="cov_view.html">Main Window File Viewer</a> will change
its background from the uncovered to the covered background color.  However, the underline will
remain under the variable to allow the user to still examine the verbose FSM information for that
state machine.
</p>

<p>
If the user excludes any state transition in the design, the "Save CDD..." option in the
<a href="file_menu.html">File Menu</a> will be enabled.  This allows the user to save the excluded property
either back to the CDD file (or to a newly named CDD file).  Doing so will allow the user to load the
CDD file at a different time and retain the knowledge of which state transitions have been excluded/included
for coverage.  Additionally, if a saved CDD file with coverage exclusion is merged with another CDD file,
the excluded state transition information is preserved for the resulting merged CDD file.
</p>

<h2>Displaying a New FSM</h2>

<p>
If the Verbose FSM Coverage window is currently displayed, the user may select a 
new FSM state variable in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a> of the Main
window.  When a new FSM is selected, its information immediately replaces the 
currently selected FSM.  This feature allows many different FSMs to be viewed 
one after the other without having to create/destroy a new window for each.
</p>

<p>
The user may also see the previous or next uncovered FSM in the main viewer by 
clicking either the "<--" button (for previous signal viewing) or the "-->" button 
(for next signal viewing).  Note that the "<--" button will be disabled if there is 
not a signal previous to the current signal in the given module and the "-->" button 
will be disabled if there is not a signal after the current signal in the given module.
</p>

<h2>Close Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking the <b>Close</b> button will cause the Verbose FSM Coverage window
to close and the current selection identifier to be removed from the Coverage Viewer
in the main window.
</p>

<h2>Help Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking the <b>Help</b> button will cause this help page to be displayed in a web
brower.
