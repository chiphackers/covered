<p>
The coverage file viewer shows the currently selected module (indicated in the 
<a href="info_bar.html">information bar</a>) Verilog source.  The coverage file viewer 
provides a read-only view of the original source code so all editing of the file must 
be done in a separate editor.  Each source code line in the viewer window is numbered 
to the left of the line to aid in debugging and finding the lines in an editor.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the coverage metric currently selected in the 
<a href="cov_bar.html">coverage metric bar</a> and the covered/uncovered/race condition 
selections in the <a href="report_menu.html">report menu</a>, the lines that are found 
to be uncovered, covered, and/or considered a race condition are highlighted in their 
respective color schemes in the coverage file viewer window.  Using the scrollbars to 
the right and below the coverage file viewer, the user can find the missed/hit lines 
quickly for further analysis.
</p>

<p>
The coverage file viewer is the place where the user can invoke the toggle and 
combinational logic detail windows.  To view one of these windows, do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Select either the "Toggle" or "Logic" coverage metric radio button in the <a href="cov_bar.html">Coverage Type Bar</a>.</li>
	<li>Select a module/instance that contains uncovered code in the <a href="mod_inst_lb.html">Module/Instance Listbox</a>.</li>
	<li>In the coverage file viewer, find code that is highlighted as being uncovered.</li>
	<li>Left click on the uncovered piece of logic.  Doing so will automatically bring up either the <a href="toggle.html">Toggle Coverage Detail Window</a> or the <a href="comb.html">Combinational Logic Detail Window</a>.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the logical blocks that have been disregarded by Covered due to a 
potential race condition existing are highlighted.  By placing the cursor over one of 
these logical blocks, the reason for why the logical block was disregarded is output 
in the <a href="info_bar.html">information bar</a>.
</p>

<p>
To view a new module/instance, simply left click on one in the Module/Instance Listbox.  
The source code for the selected module/instance will be immediately loaded into the 
coverage file viewer in the currently selected coverage metric.
</p>

<p>
To view a new coverage metric, simply left click on one of the coverage metrics in 
the Coverage Type Bar.  The currently selected module/instance will be immediately 
updated in the coverage file viewer, highlighting the uncovered/covered code for the 
current metric.
