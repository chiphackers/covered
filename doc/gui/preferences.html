<p>
The preferences window allows the user to adjust the view of some of the GUI elements 
for the purpose of more easily analyzing coverage information for a specific user.
Figure 1 shows the preferences window that is created when the user selects the
<strong>Tools > Preferences...</strong> menu option from the main window.

<h2>Select Highlight Color Frame</h2>

<p>
This frame contains six buttons that affect the foreground and background colors
used to highlight code in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a> portion
of the main window.  The buttons on the left change the foreground color while the
buttons the right change the background colors.  The currently selected
foreground/background colors are displayed on the buttons themselves to allow the user
to see the selections prior to committing to them by clicking the <strong>OK</strong>
button at the bottom of the Preferences window.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Change Uncovered Foreground</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the foreground color to use for logic that is not fully 
	covered in the logic window.  Figure 2. shows what the color selection window looks 
	like.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Uncovered Background</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the background color to use for logic that is not fully 
	covered in the logic window.  To view highlighted text, this color value should not 
	be set to the same value as the "Uncovered Foreground" color.  Figure 2. shows what 
	the color selection window looks like.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Covered Foreground</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the foreground color to use for logic that is fully covered 
	in the logic window.  Figure 2. shows what the color selection window looks like.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Covered Background</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the background color to use for logic that is fully 
	covered in the logic window.  To view highlighted text, this color value should 
	not be set to the same value as the "Covered Foreground" color.  Additionally, to 
	help distinguish covered logic from uncovered logic (when both information is 
	viewed together), it is important that this color be different from the "Uncovered 
	Background" color.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Race Condition Foreground</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the foreground color to use for logic that was found to 
	contain a potential race condition and was, therefore, eliminated from coverage 
	consideration by Covered.  Figure 2. shows what the color selection window looks 
	like.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Race Condition Background</strong><
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the background color to use for logic that was found 
	to contain a potential race condition and was, therefore, eliminated from coverage 
	consideration by Covered.  To view highlighted text, this color value should not 
	be set to the same value as the "Race Condition Foreground" color.  Additionally, 
	to help distinguish this type of logic from covered and uncovered logic (when 
	either of these pieces of information are viewed together), it is important that 
	this color be different from the other background colors.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To adjust the color, simply move the arrows beneath the red, green, and/or blue color 
spectrums until the desired combined color (distinguished in the window in the lower 
right-hand corner of the window) is displayed.  The user may also specify the 8-bit 
color value for red, green, and/or blue in the entry field to the left of each color 
spectrum.  Finally, the user may specify the 6-digit hexidecimal color value in the 
entry field on the right-hand side of the window.  Whenever the color is modified by 
using any of these controls, all of the other controls are changed to reflect the 
current color selected.</p>

<h2>Set Acceptable Coverage Goals Frame</h2>

<p>
This frame contains four spinner boxes that contains values between 0 and 100.  These
values correspond to a coverage percentage for each coverage metric that the user
deems to be "good enough".  These values are used by the 
<a href="summary.html">Summary Window</a> to help visually identify modules/instances
that are meeting or exceeding these goals and which modules are not meeting these goals.
If a coverage percentage for a module/instance is less than this value, the module 
is colored red.  If the coverage percentage is greater than or equal to this value,
the module/instance is colored yellow (or green which indicates that the module/instance
reached 100% coverage for a given metric). 
</p>

<p>
To increase the specified percentage value, simply click on the 
<img src="images/up_button.png" alt="Up Button"> to the right of the percentage until
the desired value is displayed.  To decrease the specified percentage value, simply 
click on the <img src="images/dn_button.png" alt="Down Button"> to the right of the
percentage until the desired value is displayed.
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Line Coverage %</strong></li>
    <p>
    Sets the coverage goal of line coverage to the specified percentage to the
    right.  If line coverage for a given module/instance meets or exceeds this
    percentage value, it will be displayed yellow in the summary window.</p>
    <li><strong>Toggle Coverage %</strong></li>
    <p>
    Sets the coverage goal of toggle coverage to the specified percentage to
    the right.  If toggle coverage for a given module/instance meets or exceeds this
    percentage value, it will be displayed yellow in the summary window.</p>
    <li><strong>Combinational Logic Coverage %</strong></li>
    <p>
    Sets the coverage goal of combinational coverage to the specified percentage
    to the right.  If combinational logic coverage for a given module/instance meets
    or exceeds this percentage value, it will be displayed yellow in the summary
    window.</p>
    <li><strong>FSM State/Arc Coverage %</strong></li>
    <p>
    Sets the coverage goal of FSM state/arc coverage to the specified percentage
    to the right.  If FSM state/arc coverage for a given module/instance meets
    or exceeds this percentage value, it will be displayed yellow in the summary
    window.</p>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Preferences Configuration File</h2>
<p>
User preferences are loaded from the ".coveredrc" file that is searched for in the 
following order:</p>

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Current directory that the 'covered report -view' command was executed from.</li>
  <li>The user's home directory.</li>
  <li>The installation directory (by default this is /usr/local/share/covered).</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
If user preferences are changed in this window and the <strong>OK</strong> button is
pressed, the settings are immediately saved back to a configuration file and the GUI
is immediately updated to reflect the new user changes.  If the <strong>Cancel</strong> 
button is pressed, all changes are thrown away and the configuration file remains
unchanged.  The location of the stored configuration file depends on which configuration 
file location was initially loaded.  The following table describes this correlation.
</p>

<p>
<div align="center">
<p><strong>Table 1.  Location of Written .coveredrc File According to the 
Location of Read .coveredrc File</strong></p>
<table border>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Loaded config file location</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Stored config file location</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Current directory</td>
    <td>Current directory</td>

  <tr>
    <td>None found</td>
    <td>Current directory</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
</p>

<h2>Apply Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking on the <b>Apply</b> button will cause the currently selected preference options
to be immediately updated in Covered but will not update the preference option values
in the .coveredrc file.  This has the effect of changing the preferences for the current
application only.  Clicking on this button will not close the Preferences window.
</p>

<h2>OK Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking on the <b>OK</b> button will cause the currently selected preference options
to be immediately updated in Covered and will update the .coveredrc file with the new
values.  This also causes the Preferences window to close.
</p>

<h2>Cancel Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking on the <b>Cancel</b> button will cause the the Preferences window to close
without updating Covered with the currently selected values and without updating the
.coveredrc file.
</p>

<h2>Help Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking on the <strong>Help</strong> button will cause this help page to be displayed
in a browser.
