<p>
After a CDD file has been opened in the GUI, the module/instance selection box 
(shown in Figure 1 below) will contain either a list of all of the modules within 
the specified design or a list of all of the instances within the design, based 
on the type of report selected in the <a href="report_menu.html">Report menu</a>.  
Left-clicking on a module/instance name within this box will cause that file to be 
output in the <a href="cov_view.html">File Viewer Window</a> to the right of the 
selection box.

<p>
Depending on the selected coverage metric (specified in the 
<a href="cov_bar.html">Coverage Type View Bar</a>) and the coverage results for each 
module/instance, a module/instance item will be highlighted in the uncovered logic 
color if the corresponding module/instance was found to have uncovered logic within 
that module/instance.  If the specified module/instance was found to be fully covered 
for the currently selected metric, the name will remain unhighlighted.  This can help 
the user quickly identify modules/instances that contain uncovered logic cases 
without having to systematically click on each name in the selection box and look at 
the summary coverage information to find these cases.  Note that when a different 
coverage metric is selected, the highlights will be recalculated for that metric.  
Figure 2 below shows what the module/instance selection box looks like when populated 
with a CDD file.  Note the names in the box that are highlighted (yellow) vs. not 
highlighted.
