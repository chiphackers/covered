      The answer to this question is, "Well, that depends...". Since the format of the CDD file is only used by
      Covered, the contents and format of this file may be changed to suit the needs of Covered. This means that
      it is possible for a CDD file created from an older version of Covered to be incompatible with a newer
      version. Additionally, the developers of Covered will not make any attempts to make sure that older CDD
      files can be properly read by a newer version of Covered. It is suggested that any CDD files generated
      from a particular version of Covered be merged and/or reported on by that same version, and if Covered is
      upgraded, new CDD files should be generated.</P>

      Covered uses C assertions to make sure that internal pointers are not be 
      referenced when NULL and that certain internal situations do not arise. If you 
      receive some type of assertion error when running Covered, it means that 
      something went wrong internally in Covered. The error is NOT due to user 
      error. Please submit a bug report containing the assertion error message, 
      file and line number. Additionally, run the Covered command with the -D 
      global option (covered -D &lt;command&gt;) and provide the output from doing 
      this with the bug report (please only specify tail of output if the output is

      Covered's development consists of two active "branches":  the stable branch and the development branch.  When
      a new stable branch is created (ex. 0.4 or 0.5), it represents the latest version of the development branch.
      As Covered's development branch is worked on (adding new features, changes to the core, etc.), the stable branch
      remains in a feature frozen stage.  Only bug fixes, documentation updates or minor enhancements (changes that
      will not affect the core code) are made to the stable branch.  When a number of these changes have been
      accumulated on the stable branch, a snapshot of the stable branch is made available for public download (ex.
      0.4.1).  User's of the stable release should expect no major feature changes from minor rev to minor rev
      and should expect a somewhat polished version of the project (few if any bugs and correct user documentation). </P>

      User's of the development releases should expect to see more bugs and fewer documentation consistencies (although
      an attempt is made to minimize both) but should expect lots of feature additions, optimizations, improvements, etc.
      from release to release.  Bug findings found in the stable release are applied to the development branch when
      applicable.  It is important to note that both the stable and development releases contain a regression
      testbench that must fully pass before either release is made.  This should minimize bugs in both releases and
      give user's of either branch a level of confidence that the release is usable.
