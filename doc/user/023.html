      The verbose output for combinational coverage is a bit more sophisticated than the line or toggle.
      Basically, for each expression that was found to not be fully covered (either the expression itself or
      some sub-expression in the tree was not fully covered), the expression is output with various
      sub-expressions underlined and identified with a number. Each expression is also supplied with the
      line number that the expression started at in its module file. In our example, there is an uncovered 
      expression in the module called "main" (see lines <a href="test/example.rptM.html#170">170 through 205</a>
      (numbered 5) which contains four uncovered subexpressions (numbered 1 through 4).

      string "Expression 1" tell us the number of logical combinations of this subexpression that were hit
      (in this case 2 combinations were hit) and the total number of logical combinations that this
      subexpression can have (in this case 3 combinations were achievable). The character string below this

      The table below this information for subexpression 1, lists the potential combinations that this
      subexpression could have reached with a '*' character placed underneath the combination(s) that were missed.
      In the case of subexpression 1, the left and right subexpressions did not evaluate to values of 1 simultaneously
      The letter 'L' above each possible combination indicates the value that the left subexpression achieved at
      the same time as the value under the right subexpression indicated with the letter 'R'.  Legal values for a
      subexpression are '0', '1' or '-' (which indicates that this subexpression value could either be 0 or 1).
