      The Covered project has a user mailing list. Whenever there are stable releases being made of the
      project, an e-mail will get sent out to this list stating the new release is available. Additionally, the
      mailing list is a great way to bring up usability issues with the tool and, of course, bugs. The mailing
      list can also be useful if you have a question about using Covered -- there is probably someone else
      who has encountered the same problem that might be able to provide you with some help.</P>

      <ul>
        <li> [0.] This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by
             the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
             The ``Program'', below, refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
             means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
             containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
             translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
             the term ``modification''.) Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.
             <p>
             Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;
             they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output
             from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
             (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what
             the Program does. </li>
             <p>
        <li> [1.] You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
             receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
             each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
             notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
             recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
             <p>
             You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
             offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. </li>
             <p>
        <li> [2.] You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming
             a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the
             terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
             <p>
             <ul>
               <li> [a.] You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
                    changed the files and the date of any change. </li>
                    <p>
               <li> [b.] You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part
                    contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
                    whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. </li>
                    <p>
               <li> [c.] If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
                    cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to
                    print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
                    that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how
                    to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
                    to print an announcement.) </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
             These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work
             are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
             works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
             you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of
             a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the
             terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and
             thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
             <p>
             Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work
             written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution
             of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
             <p>
             In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with
             a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
             other work under the scope of this License.
             <p>
        <li> [3.] You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object
             code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do
             one of the following:
             <p>
             <ul>
               <li> [a.] Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
                    be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
                    for software interchange; or, </li>
                    <p>
               <li> [b.] Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third
                    party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
                    complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under
                    the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, </li>
                    <p>
               <li> [c.] Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding
                    source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                    received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
                    Subsection b above.) </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
             The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For
             an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus
             any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
             installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
             include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
             components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
             that component itself accompanies the executable.
             <p>
             If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
             then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
             the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
             code. </li>
             <p>
        <li> [4.] You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided
             under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
             void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
             copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
             parties remain in full compliance. </li>
             <p>
        <li> [5.] You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
             grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
             prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
             (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
             terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. </li>
             <p>
        <li> [6.] Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
             automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
             subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
             exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
             parties to this License. </li>
             <p>
        <li> [7.] If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
             reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
             or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
             of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
             License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program
             at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
             all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy
             both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
             <p>
             If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
             balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
             circumstances.
             <p>
             It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right
             claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
             integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.
             Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
             system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if
             he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
             choice.
             <p>
             This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of
             this License. </li>
             <p>
        <li> [8.] If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents
             or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
             may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution
             is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
             limitation as if written in the body of this License. </li>
             <p>
        <li> [9.] The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License
             from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
             in detail to address new problems or concerns.
             <p>
             Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this
             License which applies to it and ``any later version'', you have the option of following the terms and
             conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
             the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published
             by the Free Software Foundation.
             <p>
        <li> [10.] If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution
             conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
             the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for
             this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
             our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
             <p>
             <p><br>
             <p><br>
             <center> NO WARRANTY</center><br> </li>
             <p>
        <li> [11.] BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE
             EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
             AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
             IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
             PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
             THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. </li>
             <p>
        <li> [12.] IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
             OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
             FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
             OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
             INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
             OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </li>
