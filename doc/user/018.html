      Module reporting combines the results of all instances that come from the same 
      module. That is, when a module is instantiated multiple times in a design, the 
      coverage results from all covered instances are merged together and output as one

      Instance reporting displays each instance in the covered design separately (no 
      combining occurs). This reporting format is useful for determining if certain 
      instances within a design are being neglected. For instance, if a module is 
      instantiated four times (i.e., four instances of the same buffer), it may be that 
      the first buffer is used more often than the other three buffers. This could 
      indicate controller errors or just an indication that there was not enough 
      activity during simulation to fill the other buffers (need to bolster diagnostics 
      or possibly some buffers could be removed?) This type of information would not

      The reason for having this option is two-fold (and maybe there are other reasons). 
      First, this option is useful in debugging the report command since it let's the 
      user evaluate whether a particular signal or portion of logic was actually fully 
      covered or not. Second, it may be useful for user's of the tool to understand 
      what logic is being evaluated for coverage and what logic is not. If only 
      uncovered logic was supplied for evaluation of the tool, one could not evaluate 
      the effectiveness of the tool. However, by allowing the user to see what logic 
      is covered and uncovered, a more full picture of the tool's capability can be
