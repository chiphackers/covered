      Due to Covered's method of abstracting coverage from a dumpfile, a partial 
      "resimulation" of the design is needed to obtain proper statistics for line, 
      combinational logic and FSM metrics. Therefore, accurately resimulating what 
      occurred in the actual simulation is a requirement for obtaining correct 
      results. This can be easily achieved so long as the design doesn't contain 
      any code that could result in potential race conditions.</P>

      To avoid this problem Covered performs automatic race condition checking 
      on the specified design after parsing has been completed but before 
      simulation/scoring is performed. All statement blocks in the design that 
      don't adhere to certain coding guidelines are removed from coverage consideration 
      by Covered. By following these coding guidelines, a design should be void of 
      race condition scenarios that would lead to faulty simulation results. The

      The first mode of operation is the recommended mode of operation as this will

      Even though race condition information is displayed (assuming the -rS option was 
      not specified in the score command-line) during the scoring process, it may be 
      convenient to view this information in a generated report as well. Because of this 
      need, Covered saves all race condition information to the CDD file for use in 
      using the report command. By specifying 'r' in the -m option to the report command 
      (race condition report output is not turned on by default), the statement blocks 
      which were eliminated from coverage consideration will be output to the coverage 
      report file. Summary coverage will contain the total number of statement blocks 
      eliminated for each module. Verbose coverage will contain each eliminated statement 
      block, organized by module, specifying both the starting line of the eliminated 
      statement block and the reason for why the statement block was removed.</P>

      Though highly discouraged, Covered does have a means to skip the race condition checking
      step altogether for situations where the user does not believe race conditions to exist in
      their design and does not want Covered to automatically throw out those procedural blocks
      for Covered consideration.  The advantages to doing this are:

          <LI> Better performance in scoring the design (the race condition checking step is skipped entirely)</LI>
          <LI> For designs which do not contain any real race condition (that Covered is saying "might" exist),
               more logic can be included for coverage. </LI>

      Of course, with these advantages comes a risk.  If code is deemed to not contain any race conditions but
      does indeed contain one or more, the coverage numbers may be flawed, and these types of "errors" are not
      assumed to be Covered bugs.  With all of that said, to ignore race condition checking completely, simply
      add the '-rI' option to the score command-line.
