    Line coverage is the quickest way to determine what logic in your design is being exercised and which logic has not
    be exercised during simulation.  If a line was found to not be simulated, this is an indication that there was some
    event that did not occur or did not occur at the proper time to cause a previous conditional expression to be
    evaluated to true or false.  For example, if a block of code looked something like:
  </p><p>
    </p><div class="example"><a name="example.gui.line"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 18.1. Line Coverage Example</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
  always @(posedge clock)  // Line 1
    if( a )                // Line 2
      b &lt;= 1'b0;           // Line 3
    else                   // Line 4
      b &lt;= 1'b1;           // Line 5
      </pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break">
  </p><p>
    If line 3 was shown to be not covered, this would indicate that at the positive edge of the term "clock", the value
    of "a" never evaluated to a value of 1 (true).  To make line 3 become covered, we would need to setup a situation in
    the diagnostic that caused "a" to become true at the positive edge of the term "clock".
  </p><p>
    On the other hand, if all lines 2 - 5 were found to be uncovered, this would indicate the the term "clock" never made
    a transition from some value to a 1 (true) value during simulation.

      To view line coverage for all uncovered lines for a specific module/instance, do the following:
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
            Make sure that the <span class="bold"><strong>Show Uncovered</strong></span> menu item in the
            <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.reportmenu" title="The Report Menu">report menu</a> is selected.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Select the line coverage metric in the <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.covbar" title="17.2. The Coverage Type View Bar">coverage bar</a> by left-clicking
            on selection button to the left of "Line".
          </p></li><li><p>
            Select one of the modules/instances that is highlighted in the uncovered color scheme (to change this color
            scheme, see <a href="chapter.gui.preferences.html" title="Chapter 28. Navigating the Preferences Window">Chapter 28, <i>Navigating the Preferences Window</i></a>) in the <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.listbox" title="17.3. The Module/Instance Listbox">listbox</a>.
            This will cause the selected module/instance source code to be displayed in the
            <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.viewer" title="17.4. The Coverage File Viewer">file viewer</a>.
          </p></li></ol></div><p>
    </p><p>
      Once the selected module/instance has been displayed, scroll down in the Coverage File Viewer window (using the
      scroll bars to the right and below the Coverage File Viewer window) until you have reached a line that is
      highlighted in the uncovered color scheme. The line number of the highlighted line will be printed to the left of
      the source code line.  This line represents a line that was found to not be hit during the simulation of this
      module/instance.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.gui.line.excl"></a>18.2. Excluding/Included Uncovered Lines from Line Coverage</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Any uncovered line in the design may be included/excluded from coverage consideration.  To the left of each
      uncovered line is an underlined "I" (line is currently included in coverage) or "E" (line is currently excluded
      in coverage).  Clicking on an "I" will cause a <a href="chapter.gui.exclude.html" title="Chapter 29. The Exclusion Reason Popup Window">exclusion reason popup
      window</a> to be displayed, allowing you to specify a reason for excluding this line.  Once a reason has been
      entered, the coverage exclusion property of the line will change to an "E" and be highlighted in the "covered"
      color scheme and the summary line coverage information will be recalculated and redisplayed in the
      <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.listbox" title="17.3. The Module/Instance Listbox">listbox</a> to reflect the current status of line coverage for the
      current module/instance.  Clicking on an "E" will cause the current line to be displayed in the "uncovered"
      color scheme, the "E" will change to an "I", and the summary line coverage will be recalculated and redisplayed
      in the summary listbox.  <a href="chapter.gui.line.html#figure.gui.line.include" title="Figure 18.1. Example of uncovered line included for line coverage consideration">Figure 18.1, &#8220;Example of uncovered line included for line coverage consideration&#8221;</a> shows an uncovered line that is included for
      coverage consideration.  <a href="chapter.gui.line.html#figure.gui.line.exclude" title="Figure 18.2. Example of uncovered line excluded for line coverage consideration">Figure 18.2, &#8220;Example of uncovered line excluded for line coverage consideration&#8221;</a> shows the same line which is now excluded
      from coverage consideration.

    </p><p>
      In addition to changing the line coverage information, the combinational logic coverage information for an
      uncovered statement on that line will also be implicitly excluded from coverage (though the exclude properties for
      each subexpression of the statement will not change).
    </p><p>
      If the user excludes any line in the design, the <span class="bold"><strong>Save CDD...</strong></span> option in the
      <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.filemenu" title="The File Menu">file</a> menu will be enabled.  This allows the user to save the excluded property
      either back to the CDD file (or to a newly named CDD file). Doing so will allow the user to load the CDD file at a
      different time and retain the knowledge of which lines have been excluded/included for coverage.  Additionally, if
      a saved CDD file with coverage exclusion is merged with another CDD file, the excluded line information is
      preserved for the resulting merged CDD file.
    </p><p>
      If a line has been excluded from coverage and an exclusion reason was specified, you can view the reason for exclusion
      by right-click-and-hold on the "E" on the desired line.  This will cause a tooltip-style window to be displayed specifying
      the reason for exclusion.  The background color of the tooltip will be the same color as the "covered" background color
      to help distinguish it from a normal tooltip.  To cause the exclusion reason tooltip to disappear, simply release the
      button.

      Once the selected module/instance has been displayed, scroll down in the Coverage File Viewer window (using the
      scroll bars to the right and below the Coverage File Viewer window) until you have reached a line that is
      highlighted in the covered color scheme. The line number of the highlighted line will be printed to the left of the
      source code line.  This line represents a line that was found to be hit during the simulation of this
