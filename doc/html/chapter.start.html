      Before you are ready to being scoring, merging and generating coverage reports from the design, you will first need to
      decide whether you want to post-process VCD/LXT2 -formatted dumpfiles generated from simulation, co-process VCD/LXT2 -formatted
      dumpfiles using two processes (one for the simulation process and one for the Covered process) and a Unix FIFO, or whether
      you want to accummulate coverage information alongside the simulator using the simulator's VPI interface. There are advantages and
      disadvantages to these methods, so select the method that will best work for you.
    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.start.methods.dumppost"></a>Post-processing VCD/LXT2 dumpfiles</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Generating post-process coverage information from VCD/LXT2 -formatted dumpfiles requires three steps:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Compile the simulator to dump in the specified format.</p></li><li><p>Run the simulation.</p></li><li><p>Run Covered's score command using the dumpfile as input along with the design.</p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Performing these steps will generate the needed CDD file that can be used for merging or reporting.
        The advantages to this approach is that the steps are fairly simple and are compiler/simulator -independent. However,
        there are two main drawbacks. First, compiling with dumping enabled often slows simulation by some significant factor.
        Second, the dumpfiles generated from simulation can often be quite large (especially for VCD dumping), consuming a lot
        of disk space. Additionally, if your simulator dumps in a format different from VCD or LXT2, you will need to perform
        an additional step in transforming the original dumpfile into one of these formats. This is often a time-consuming task
        if the design and/or dumpfile is significantly large. If you are generating lots of dumpfiles for coverage (say from
        running a regression), the amount of disk space needed to store these files can be tremendous, making this approach
        almost not feasible.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.start.methods.dumpco"></a>Co-processing VCD/LXT2 dumpfiles via FIFO</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Generating co-process coverage information from VCD/LXT2 -formatted dumpfiles requires four steps:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Compile the simulator to dump in the specified format.</p></li><li><p>Create a Unix FIFO via the <code class="code">mkfifo <span class="emphasis"><em>fifoname</em></span></code> command.</p></li><li><p>Create an empty CDD file for the design using Covered's score command.</p></li><li><p>
              Run the simulation and Covered's score command simultaneously.  The following is an example of a testbench and
              command-line commands:
            </p><p>
              </p><div class="example"><a name="example.start.methods.dumpco"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 7.1. Running Covered Alongside a Simulation Process Using a Unix FIFO to Pass Dumpfile Information</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
  # Module listing for file "test.v"
  module tb;
    ...
    initial begin
            $dumpfile( "dump_fifo" );
            $dumpvars( 0, tb );
            ...
    end
    ...
  endmodule

  # Command-line output
  &gt; mkfifo dump_fifo
  &gt; vcs test.v
  &gt; covered score -t tb -v test.v -o test.cdd
  &gt; ./simv &amp;
  &gt; covered score -cdd test.cdd -vcd dump_fifo
                </pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break">
            </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><p>
        The end result of these steps is the same CDD file that results from using the dumpfile method described above.
        The primary advantages of this approach are that no dumpfiles are actually created, saving on disk space, and
        it does not significantly slow down the simulation process.  Because both simulation and coverage scoring
        occur simultaneously, there should be a wall clock time improvement with this method.
      </p><p>
        The drawbacks of this approach are basically that the time improvement won't be significant if you are running
        on a single processor/core system and that it is restricted to machines that support the Unix fifo (this may
        not be an actual restriction, however).
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.start.methods.vpi"></a>Using the VPI interface to gather coverage information</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Generating coverage information using the VPI interface of the simulator requires three main steps:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              Create a base CDD file from the design along with a top-level Verilog module and PLI table file (this second
              file is needed for the commercial VCS compiler).
            </p></li><li><p>
              Compile the simulator using the Covered VPI module (or shared object).
            </p></li><li><p>
              Run the simulation.
            </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><p>
        The end result of these steps is the same CDD file that results from using the dumpfile method described
        above. The primary advantage of this approach is that no dumpfiles are required, saving on disk space and dumpfile
        processing time. The drawbacks of this approach are the following:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
              Simulation runs much slower using the VPI and Covered (most likely slower than creating dumpfiles from the
              simulator).
            </p></li><li><p>
              Covered VPI modules are only available for certain compilers (Icarus Verilog, Cver and VCS currently); however,
              adding support for other compilers should not be a difficult thing to do.
            </p></li><li><p>
              The VPI modules will only work for compilers that support the VPI interface (a Verilog-2001 feature).
            </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.start.dump"></a>7.2. What is needed for dumpfile scoring?</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Before Covered can be invoked for dumpfile scoring, you must have a simulatable Verilog design and a VCD or LXT2 dumpfile
      containing information from a simulation run of the design that dumps the module(s) that you want to check for coverage.
      The VCD dumpfile style was chosen due to its universal support by Verilog simulators while the LXT2 dumpfile style was
      chosen due to its compactness and growing support by other open source simulators and dumpfile readers. Once you have
      these two parts, you are ready to begin generating coverage results.
    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.start.dump.selecting"></a>Selecting What to Dump</h3></div></div></div><p>
        If coverage is being scored via a VCD/LXT2 dumpfile, it is necessary for the user to setup $dumpfile and $dumpvars calls
        to dump the various modules that are being scored.  Covered allows the user to do this in one of two ways.
      </p><p>
        First, the user may hand create these calls within their testbench.  If this approach is taken, it is necessary that all
        modules being scored by Covered be included in the $dumpvars calls.  Eliminating scored modules from the dumpfile will result
        in inaccurate coverage information.  Additionally, it is mandatory that the dumpfile start at time 0 and that all dump information
        be included in the dumpfile (i.e., using the $dumplimit system task could cause dump information to be lost that will result
        in inaccurate coverage results).
      </p><p>
        Second, the user may take advantage of Covered's -dumpvars option to the score command.  Adding this parameter (and the optional
        -top_ts option) will create a top-level module file that can be compiled along with the testbench that will dump all of the parts
        of the Covered design that are needed by Covered.  Using this approach will result in the best overall performance for dumpfile
        coverage accumulation as all unnecessary dump information will be stripped, resulting in both faster simulation and faster
        coverage scoring.
      </p><p>
        If the second approach is taken, simply use the score command to parse the design and output an unscored CDD and the dumpvars module,
        using a command similar to the following:
      </p><p>
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  covered score -t top -v dut.v -dumpvars dut_dump.v -o dut.cdd
        </pre><p>
      </p><p>
        If `timescale is specified at the top of dut.v, it may be necessary for compiling purposes to have the timescale specified at the top
        of dut_dump.v.  To do this, simply specify the -top_ts option in the score command.  Note that the example command does not list either
        the -vcd or -lxt options.  If either of these options are present on the score command-line, the dut_dump.v file will not be created
        and the score command will attempt to score the design with the specified dumpfile.
      </p><p>
        After the dut_dump.v file has been created, simply compile it along with your DUT as a top-level module.  For example,
      </p><p>
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  iverilog dut.v dut_dump.v
        </pre><p>
      </p><p>
        After the simulation has been compiled and run, a dumpfile called "dut_dump.vcd" (using the above example) will exist in the run
        directory.  This dumpfile can then be used in a second call to the score command via the -vcd or -lxt options along with the
        unscored CDD file to create a scored version of the CDD file.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.start.dump.vcd"></a>Creating a VCD dumpfile</h3></div></div></div><p>
        By default, the $dumpfile system task call will create a file and populate it with VCD-style dumpfile information.  Simply
        use the resulting VCD dumpfile in the -vcd option to the score command to obtain coverage for that design.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.start.dump.lxt"></a>Creating an LXT2 dumpfile</h3></div></div></div><p>
        An LXT2 dumpfile can be created in several different ways depending on the Verilog simulation tool that you are using. If
        you are using the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.icarus.com/eda/verilog" target="_top">Icarus Verilog</a> open source simulator, you can
        simply generate an LXT2-style dumpfile by specifying the -lxt2 option to the simulator command-line. For example, if you
        had a file called "foo.v" that contained the same $dumpfile and $dumpvars commands used for VCD dumping and compiled it
        with Icarus Verilog into a VVP file called "a.out", you could cause Icarus Verilog to generate an LXT2 dumpfile (instead
        of a VCD dumpfile by calling "vvp a.out -lxt2". This will cause an LXT2 style dumpfile instead of the standard VCD style
        dumpfile.
      </p><p>
        You can also transform many different dumpfile formats into an LXT2 style dumpfile with the helper programs that come with
        the <a class="ulink" href="http://home.nc.rr.com/gtkwave/" target="_top">GtkWave</a> waveform viewer.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.start.vpi"></a>7.3. What is needed for VPI scoring?</h2></div></div></div><p>
      After Covered has been configured and built to include the creation of a VPI loadable module or shared object file (see
      <a class="xref" href="chapter.installation.html#section.installation.configuring" title="6.3. Configuring the build">Section 6.3, &#8220;Configuring the build&#8221;</a> for details), Covered is capable of scoring during a simulation run by using the VPI
      (Verilog Procedural Interface) access mechanism. This is done by loading the Covered VPI module (or shared object) into the
      simulator executable prior to running (depending on the simulator being used). The following steps should be taken to create
      a scored CDD file using this method.
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
            Create the Verilog file that will be compiled as a top-level module in the design (alongside the actual top-level(s)).
          </p><p>
            This is done by running the score command with the -vpi option. The following example command-line shows how this step
            is done, creating a file called "covered_vpi.v".
          </p><p>
            <code class="code">&gt; covered score -t top -vpi</code>
          </p></li><li><p>
            Compile the simulator executable, including the previously generated file and the Covered VPI module. See the compile
            instructions for the Icarus Verilog, Cver or VCS simulators below.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Run the simulation. Once simulation is complete, the resulting CDD file will be a completely scored database, ready to be
            merged with other CDD files from the same design or reported on.
