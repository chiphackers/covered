    Due to Covered's method of abstracting coverage from a dumpfile, a partial "resimulation" of the design is needed 
    to obtain proper statistics for line, combinational logic and FSM metrics. Therefore, accurately resimulating what 
    occurred in the actual simulation is a requirement for obtaining correct results. This can be easily achieved so 
    long as the design doesn't contain any code that could result in potential race conditions.
  </p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.race.guidelines"></a>4.1. Checked Coding Guidelines</h2></div></div></div><p>
      To avoid this problem Covered performs automatic race condition checking on the specified design after parsing 
      has been completed but before simulation/scoring is performed. All statement blocks in the design that don't 
      adhere to certain coding guidelines are removed from coverage consideration by Covered. By following these coding 
      guidelines, a design should be void of race condition scenarios that would lead to faulty simulation results. The 
      following coding guidelines are applied by Covered when checking for race conditions:
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
            All sequential logic and latches use non-blocking assignments.
          </p></li><li><p>
            All combinational logic in an always block uses blocking assignments.
          </p></li><li><p>
            All mixed sequential and combinational logic in the same always block uses non-blocking assignments.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Blocking and non-blocking assignments should not be used in the same always block.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Assignments made to a variable should only be done within one always block.
          </p></li><li><p>
            The $strobe system call should only be used to display variables that were assigned using non-blocking 
            assignments. (Not currently implemented)
          </p></li><li><p>
            No #0 procedural assignments should exist. (Not currently implemented)
          </p></li></ol></div><p>
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.race.handling"></a>4.2. Race Condition Handling</h2></div></div></div><p>
    If Covered detects a block as violating any one of the above mentioned coding guidelines, it will do one of two 
    things depending on options specified to the score command by the user.
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
            If the <span class="bold"><strong><code class="code">-rS</code></strong></span>, <span class="bold"><strong><code class="code">-rW</code></strong></span> 
            or none of the -r options are specified, Covered will simply remove the non-conforming always block from 
            coverage consideration and continue with scoring. <span class="bold"><strong><code class="code">-rW</code></strong></span> will 
            display a message describing detected race conditions during the scoring command while the 
            <span class="bold"><strong><code class="code">-rS</code></strong></span> option will display no messages.
          </p></li><li><p>
            If the <span class="bold"><strong><code class="code">-rE</code></strong></span> option is specified, Covered will halt the score 
            command after all race condition checking has been performed with a message to the user specifying how many 
            always blocks were found to be in non-compliance to the race-condition-free coding guidelines.
          </p></li></ol></div><p>
    </p><p>
      The first mode of operation is the recommended mode of operation as this will allow Covered to continue calculating 
      coverage information for the design while still providing accurate coverage information for the logic that is still 
      under consideration. The second mode of operation is meant to allow the user to use Covered as a race-condition 
      checking tool.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.race.avoiding"></a>4.3. Avoiding Race Condition Checking</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Covered has three means of avoiding race condition checking: (1) skip race condition checking for the entire design 
      altogether, (2) skip race condition checking for one or more specified modules, or (3) place inline pragmas around
      specific logic blocks to avoid checking. The main advantage for using either of these methods is to allow Covered
      to score more of the design that would otherwise be excluded due to failing a static race condition checkpoint.
      The main disadvantage to avoiding race condition checking using either of these methods is that you could potentially
      be ignoring code that contains an actual race condition, causing Covered to potentially generate incorrect coverage
      information without warning. These types of "errors" are not assumed to be Covered bugs.
    </p><p>
      To exclude the entire design from race condition checking, simply specify the 
      <span class="bold"><strong><code class="code">-rI</code></strong></span> option on the score command-line.  This will cause Covered to skip 
      the race condition checking phase entirely, outputting a warning message (unless the global -Q option has been 
      specified). The use of this command-line option is highly discouraged due to its general assumption by the user that 
      the entire design is void of race conditions.
    </p><p>
      To exclude an entire module from race condition checking, simply specify the
      <span class="bold"><strong><code class="code">-rI=</code><span class="emphasis"><em>module name</em></span></strong></span> option on the score command-line.
      This option may be specified one or more times on the score command-line (once for each module to be skipped).
    </p><p>
      To exclude portions of the design from race condition checking, the user may also place inline comment-based 
      pragmas in the design and specify the <span class="bold"><strong><code class="code">-rP</code></strong></span> option to the score 
      command-line. The inline pragmas look like the following:
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="example"><a name="example.race"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 4.1. Using a Race Condition Pragma</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
  module foobar;
      
    ...
      
    // racecheck off 
    always @(posedge clock) begin
      ...
    end
    // racecheck on
      
    ...
      
  endmodule
        </pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break">
    </p><p>
      This example will cause the initial block surrounded by the <code class="code">racecheck</code> pragmas to be ignored from race condition
      checking, thus making it available for coverage consideration. If there are any race condition rules that this block
      contains or is a part of, they will not be reported.
    </p><p>
      The keyword <code class="code">racecheck</code> is the default pragma keyword for race condition checking avoidance; however, 
      if this name needs to be changed to something else by the user (i.e., if <code class="code">racecheck</code> is used by another 
      tool and has a different meaning or format), the user may make this keyword anything they please as long as the meaning is 
      preserved (i.e., <code class="code"><span class="emphasis"><em>keyword</em></span> off</code> means that race condition checking should be turned 
      off for all subsequent code until its matching <code class="code"><span class="emphasis"><em>keyword</em></span> on</code> pragma is seen). The 
      new name of this keyword is passed to the -rP option by specifying 
      <span class="bold"><strong><code class="code">-rP=<span class="emphasis"><em>keyword</em></span></code></strong></span>. It should also be noted that race 
      condition pragmas can be embedded within each other (all code within the outside pair are removed from race 
      checking) and race condition avoidance pragmas (<code class="code">racecheck off</code>) are in effect on a file-basis -- that is, 
      they are in effect even beyond their current scope but are no longer in effect after the current file.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.race.conditions"></a>4.4. Reporting Race Conditions</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Even though race condition information is displayed (assuming the -rS option was not specified in the score 
      command-line) during the scoring process, it may be convenient to view this information in a generated report as 
      well. Because of this need, Covered saves all race condition information to the CDD file for use in using the 
      report command. By specifying 'r' in the -m option to the report command (race condition report output is not 
      turned on by default), the statement blocks which were eliminated from coverage consideration will be output to the 
      coverage report file. Summary coverage will contain the total number of statement blocks eliminated for each 
      module. Verbose coverage will contain each eliminated statement block, organized by module, specifying both the 
      starting line of the eliminated statement block and the reason for why the statement block was removed.
