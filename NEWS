Covered-Related NEWS
====================
    * 7/21/2002

Release covered-20020721 made.  Lots of bug fixes and feature enhancements.  Fixed output
to a more understandable format when modules cannot be found during parsing.  Added support
for the -e option which allows the user to omit modules from coverage.  Fixed single and
multi-bit selectors.  These should work properly now, selecting the correct values from
vectors.  Added -D option to allow the user define values at the command-line.  Fixed
problems associated with the `ifdef/`ifndef directives.  Fixed problem with module trees
that were 3 or more modules deep.  Created TODO list for items that I want to complete
before 0.1 stable release.  This will give users/developers an insight to the short-term
goals of the project.  All items in TODO list preceded by an X have also been worked on
in this release.  Improved performance of signal/expression binding.  Support has been
added to allow implicit wire declarations.  Added ability to parse the design and score
the dumpfile in two calls to the score command.  This could aid performance later as a
design would only need to be parsed once.  More diagnostics have been added to the
Verilog test suite.  Development and user documentation has been updated to bring them
up-to-date with current functionality.

Release covered-20020715 made.  Several bug fixes for problems found in previous release
and additional Verilog constructs are now supported.  The `ifdef, `else, and `endif
directives are now supported.  VCD scoping problems have been dealt with.  It should be
possible now to get coverage results on an entire tree of Verilog instances.  It should
also be possible to provide a dumpfile that contains more information than is necessary
for getting coverage.  Some performance improvements have been made that will be noticeable
for larger designs.  Fixed bugs for always statements that did not contain any coverage-able
code.  Support is now in place for concatenation and replication in operations.  The
binding phase has been revamped to provide better performance, easier maintenance and
less memory consumption.  New diagnostics have been added to start testing new code support.
Full regression passes.

    * 7/11/2002

Release covered-20020711 made.  This release contains a lot of fixes to the score and report
commands.  Proper support for `include and `define preprocessor now available.  Fixes to the
-y, -I, and -f options to score command.  These now seem to working correctly.  Added -D and
-Q options to covered (for score, merge and report commands) for adjusting amount of output
to the screen.  The -D option causes debug information to be spewed to standard output for
debugging tool problems (not recommended for standard usage).  The -Q option will omit all
output to standard output (stderr is still displayed).  By default, the minimal amount of output
is displayed to show tool progress.  Added proper support for default case, casex and casez
statements.  Fixed a lot of problems in the report command output, including reformatting the
toggle information to help make this more readable.  Lots of bug fixes and support enhancements
make upgrading to this version worthwhile.

    * 7/6/2002

Second release of Covered (covered-20020706) made.  Proper support for case, casex and casez
now exists and has been tested to an extent.  Fixed problem with reading VCD files appropriately.
Support for multi-bit anyedge (i.e., always @(b) ...) is now installed.  Lots of other bugs
in the first release have been fixed.  I have noticed a small performance degradation by changing
the VCD reader and am looking into it.  All in all, this release fixes many bugs and enhances
support for case statements and always blocks.

    * 7/3/2002

Finally release first unstable version of Covered in tarball format. This version should 
be considered alpha at this point but may be considered ready for good testing. Please 
read the release note that accompanies the pointer to the download for information on what 
type of code is currently supported for testing purposes. Happy bug finding!

    * 6/19/2002

Added beginnings of development on-line documentation. At the moment, this documentation 
mostly lays out the ground-work for interested developers. Lots of details are missing at 
the moment; though, the generated documentation contains a lot of source-code-specific 
information. With initial documentation out of the way, for the most part, the first 
release should be right around the corner.

    * 5/1/2002

Added user on-line manual. The download still isn't available for use; however, it may be 
interesting to see how the tool will be used. By the way, the download should be available 
soon for first release. All of the features may not be present but it should be somewhat 
usable.

Created a home for the Covered utility on SourceForge.net. Currently, the HTML website is 
only available for viewing. No downloads are yet available. There are a few features that 
need to be added to the tool (and verification of those and other parts) before the source 
files and tool become available for public use. Check out the ToDo page for items that are 
on my todo list before making the tool available on-line!

    * 11/27/2001

Started working on the Covered utility. After searching long and hard for a free, open 
source code coverage utility and coming up empty, decided to start working on one. This 
utility will be available on the gEDA website and database.
