Usage:  covered merge (-h | [<options>] <existing_database> <database_to_merge>+)

   -h                         Displays this help information.

   Options:
      -o <filename>           File to output new database to.  If this argument is not
                                specified, the <existing_database> is used as the output
                                database name.
      -f <filename>           Name of file containing additional arguments to parse.
      -d <directory>          Directory to search for CDD files to include.  This option is used in
                                conjunction with the -ext option which specifies the file extension
                                to use for determining which files in the directory are CDD files.
      -ext <extension>        Used in conjunction with the -d option.  If no -ext options are specified
                                on the command-line, the default value of '.cdd' is used.  Note that
                                a period (.) should be specified.
