Usage:  covered report (-h | -view [<database_file>] | [<options>] <database_file>)

   -view                        Uses the graphical report viewer for viewing reports.  If this
                                 option is not specified, the text report will be generated.
   -h                           Displays this help information.

   Options:
      -m [l][t][c][e][f][r][a][m]  Type(s) of metrics to report.  l=line, t=toggle, c=combinational logic,
                                     e=logic event, f=FSM state/arc, r=race condition, a=assertion, m=memory.  Default is ltcef.
      -d (s|d|v)                   Level of report detail (s=summary, d=detailed, v=verbose).
                                     Default is to display summary coverage information.
      -i                           Provides coverage information for instances instead of module/task/function.
      -c                           If '-d d' or '-d v' is specified, displays covered coverage points.
                                     Default is to display uncovered results.
      -e                           If '-d d' or '-d v' is specified, displays excluded coverage points.
                                     Default is to not display excluded coverage points.
      -o <filename>                File to output report information to.  Default is standard output.
      -w [<line_width>]            Causes expressions to be output to best-fit to the specified line
                                     width.  If the -w option is specified without a value, the default
                                     line width of 105 is used.  If the -w option is not specified, all
                                     expressions are output in the format that the user specified in the
                                     Verilog source.
      -s                           Suppress outputting modules/instances that do not contain any coverage metrics.
      -b                           If combinational logic verbose output is reported and the expression is a
                                     vector operation, this option outputs the coverage information on a bitwise basis.
      -f <filename>                Name of file containing additional arguments to parse.
      -x                           Output exclusion identifiers if the '-d d' or '-d v' options are specified.  The
                                     identifiers can be used with the 'exclude' command for the purposes of
                                     excluding/including coverage points.
