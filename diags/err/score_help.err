Usage:  covered score (-h | -t <top-level_module_name> [-vcd <dumpfile> | -lxt <dumpfile> | -fst <dumpfile>] [<options>])

   Dumpfile formats:
      The VCD, LXT and FST style dumpfiles are supported by Covered.

      If either the -vcd, -lxt or -fst option is specified, the design is scored using this dumpfile
      for coverage gathering.  If neither option is specified, Covered will only create an
      initial CDD file from the design and will not attempt to score the design.  An error message
      will be displayed if both options are present on the command-line.

   -h                              Displays this help information.

   Options:
      -vpi (<name>)                Generates Verilog module called <name> which contains code to
                                     allow Covered to run as a VPI during simulation.  If <name>
                                     is not specified, the module file is called covered_vpi.v
                                     If the -vcd option is specified along with this option, this
                                     option will not be used.
      -dumpvars (<name>)           Generates Verilog module called <name> which contains code to
                                     dump only the signals in the design that are necessary for coverage
                                     purposes.  If compiled as a top-module along with your design and no
                                     other $dumpfile/$dumpvars calls are made, this dump module will provide
                                     additional performance gains.  The name of the dumpfile created is called
                                     <name>.vcd
      -top_ts <timescale>          This option is only valid when the -vpi or -dumpvars options have been specified.
                                     This option allows the user to specify a timescale for the generated
                                     Verilog module.  If this option is not specified, no timescale will
                                     be created for the generated module.  The value of <timescale> is
                                     specified as follows:
                                       (1|10|100)(s|ms|us|ns|ps|fs)/(1|10|100)(s|ms|us|ns|ps|fs)
                                     If whitespace is needed between the various values, place the
                                     entire contents of <timescale> in double quotes.
      -i <instance_name>           Verilog hierarchical scope of top-level module to score.
                                     Necessary if module to verify coverage is not the top-level
                                     module in the design.  If not specified, -t value is used.
      -o <database_filename>       Name of database to write coverage information to.
      -cdd <database_filename>     Name of database to read coverage information from (same as -o).
      -I <directory>               Directory to find included Verilog files.
      -f <filename>                Name of file containing additional arguments to parse.
      -F <module>=(<ivar>,)<ovar>  Module, input state variable and output state variable of
                                     an FSM state variable.  If input variable (ivar) is not specified,
                                     the output variable (ovar) is also used as the input variable.
      -A ovl                       Specifies that any OVL assertion found in the design should be
                                     automatically included for assertion coverage.
      -y <directory>               Directory to find unspecified Verilog files.
      -v <filename>                Name of specific Verilog file to score.
      -D <define_name>(=<value>)   Defines the specified name to 1 or the specified value.
      -p <filename>                Specifies name of file to use for preprocessor output.
      -P <parameter_scope>=<value> Performs a defparam on the specified parameter with value.
      -T min|typ|max               Specifies value to use in delay expressions of the form min:typ:max.
      -ts <number>                 If design is being scored, specifying this option will output
                                     the current timestep (by increments of <number>) to standard output.
      -S                           Outputs simulation performance information after scoring has completed.  This
                                     information is currently only useful for the developers of Covered.
      -g (<module>=)[1|2|3]        Selects generation of Verilog syntax that the parser will handle.  If
                                     <module>= is present, only the specified module will use the provided
                                     generation.  If <module>= is not specified, the entire design will use
                                     the provided generation.  1=Verilog-1995, 2=Verilog-2001, 3=SystemVerilog
                                     By default, the latest generation is parsed.
      -cli (<filename>)            Causes the command-line debugger to be used during VCD/LXT dumpfile scoring.
                                     If <filename> is specified, this file contains information saved in a previous
                                     call to savehist on the CLI and causes the history contained in this file to be
                                     replayed prior to the CLI command prompt.  If <filename> is not specified, the
                                     CLI prompt will be immediately available at the start of simulation.  This option
                                     is only available when Covered is configured with the --enable-debug option.
      -m <message>                 Allows the user to specify information about this CDD file.  This information can
                                     be anything (messages with whitespace should be surrounded by double-quotation marks),
                                     but may include something about the simulation arguments to more easily link the
                                     CDD file to its simulation for purposes of recreating the CDD file.
      -conservative                If this option is specified, any logic blocks that contain code that could cause coverage
                                     discrepancies leading to potentially inaccurate coverage results are removed from
                                     coverage consideration.  See User's Guide for more information on what type of code
                                     can lead to coverage inaccuracies.
      -Wignore                     Suppress the output of warnings during code parsing and simulation.

      -inline                                Outputs Verilog with inlined code coverage
      -inline-metrics [l][t][m][e][c][f][a]  Specifies which coverage metrics should be inlined for scoring purposes.  Only these metrics
                                               will be available for reporting and ranking.  l=line, t=toggle, m=memory, e=logic events,
                                               c=combinational logic, f=FSM, a=assertions.  Default is ltmecfa.
      -inline-comb-depth <value>             Specifies the depth in an expression tree that combinational logic coverage will be scored for.
                                               By default, combinational logic depth is infinite.
      -inline-verilator <prefix>             If you are generating inlined coverage to be simulated with Verilator, this option is required.
                                               The value of <prefix> is the value that is used as the Verilator prefix value.

   Race Condition Options:

     If race condition checks are violated by one or more blocks in the design, the following options specify to Covered
     how to handle them.

      -rS                          Silent.  Remove the logic blocks from coverage consideration without reporting the information.
      -rW                          Warning.  Remove the logic blocks from coverage consideration and report the information.  Default.
      -rE                          Error.  Report the race condition violations and stop scoring.
      -rI[=<module name>]          Ignore.  If =<module name> is not specified, do not perform race condition checking for the entire
                                     design.  If =<module name> is specified, do not perform race condition checking on the specified module
                                     only.  This option may be specified more than once.
      -rP[=<name>]                 Use pragmas.  Skip race condition checking for all code surrounded by // racecheck off/on
                                     embedded pragmas.  The "racecheck" keyword can be changed by specifying =<name> where <name>
                                     is the new name for the race condition pragma keyword.

   Optimization Options:
      -e <block_name>              Name of module, task, function or named begin/end block to not score.
      -ec                          Exclude continuous assignment blocks from coverage.
      -ea                          Exclude always blocks from coverage.
      -ei                          Exclude initial blocks from coverage.
      -ef                          Exclude final blocks from coverage.
      -ep [<name>]                 Exclude all code enclosed by pragmas.  By default, the pragmas are of
                                     the format '// coverage (on|off)'; however, if <name> is specified for
                                     this option, the pragma keyword 'coverage' will be replaced with that value.

    Note:
      The top-level module specifies the module to begin scoring.  All
      modules beneath this module in the hierarchy will also be scored
      unless these modules are explicitly stated to not be scored using
      the -e flag.

    Note:
      Any plusargs that need to be passed to the score command can be added anywhere in the score command options.
      Example:
        covered score -t main -v top.v -vcd top.vcd +plusarg_option1 +plusarg_option2=13 -o top.cdd
